We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. While TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an <i>Mtor S2159A</i> knock-in allele (<i>Mtor</i><sup>A/A</sup>) using <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promote mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 co-immunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal crosstalk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings.</p>","2021-07-07","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","","","0","0","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 34245780","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XLIJMBCF/Tooley et al. - 2021 - The innate immune kinase TBK1 directly increases m.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4DC8B9HT/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245780","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RIG-I and MDA5 are essential pathogen recognition receptors sensing viral infections while LGP2 has been described as both RLR cofactor and negative regulator. After sensing and binding to viral RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RIG-I and MDA5 undergo cytosol-to-membrane relocalization to bind and signal through the MAVS adaptor protein on intracellular membranes, thus directing downstream activation of IRF3 and innate immunity. Here, we report examination of the dynamic subcellular localization of all three RLRs within the intracellular response to dsRNA and RNA virus infection. Observations from high resolution biochemical fractionation and electron microscopy, coupled with analysis of protein interactions and IRF3 activation, show that, in resting cells, microsome but not mitochondrial fractions harbor the central components to initiate innate immune signaling. LGP2 interacts with MAVS in microsomes, blocking the RIG-I/MAVS interaction. Remarkably, in response to dsRNA treatment or RNA virus infection, LGP2 is rapidly released from MAVS and redistributed to mitochondria, temporally correlating with IRF3 activation. We reveal that IRF3 activation does not take place on mitochondria but instead occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes. Our observations suggest ER-derived membranes as key RLR signaling platforms controlled through inhibitory actions of LGP2 binding to MAVS wherein LGP2 translocation to mitochondria releases MAVS inhibition to facilitate RLR-mediated signaling of innate immunity.</p>","2020-07-07","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","15778-15788","","27","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32571931","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IQQZSGTR/Esser-Nobis et al. - 2020 - Spatiotemporal dynamics of innate immune signaling.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heterodimerization of RAF kinases as well as dephosphorylation of a conserved “S259” inhibitory site are important steps for RAF activation but the precise mechanisms and dynamics remain unclear. A ternary complex comprised of SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 (SHOC2 complex) functions as a RAF S259 holophosphatase and gain-of-function mutations in SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 that promote complex formation are found in Noonan syndrome. Here we show that SHOC2 complex-mediated S259 RAF dephosphorylation is critically required for growth factor-induced RAF heterodimerization as well as for MEK dissociation from BRAF. We also uncover SHOC2-independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK pathway activation that rely on N-region phosphorylation of CRAF. In DLD-1 cells stimulated with EGF, SHOC2 function is essential for a rapid transient phase of ERK activation, but is not required for a slow, sustained phase that is instead driven by palmitoylated H/N-RAS proteins and CRAF. Whereas redundant SHOC2-dependent and -independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK activation make SHOC2 dispensable for proliferation in 2D, KRAS mutant cells preferentially rely on SHOC2 for ERK signaling under anchorage-independent conditions. Our study highlights a context-dependent contribution of SHOC2 to ERK pathway dynamics that is preferentially engaged by KRAS oncogenic signaling and provides a biochemical framework for selective ERK pathway inhibition by targeting the SHOC2 holophosphatase.</p>","2019-07-02","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","13330-13339","","27","116","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs. ATR inhibitor VE822 combined with PARPi extended survival of mice bearing GSC-derived orthotopic tumors, irrespective of PARPi-sensitivity. These studies identify a role of CDK18 in ATR-regulated HR.

Belvarafenib induced ARAF mutant dimers, and dimers containing mutant ARAF were active in the presence of inhibitor. ARAF mutations may serve as a general resistance mechanism for RAF dimer inhibitors as the mutants exhibit reduced sensitivity to a panel of type II RAF inhibitors.

Importantly, switching from combined fulvestrant and CDK4/6i upon resistance to dual combination with AKTi and fulvestrant does not prevent tumor progression. Furthermore, triple combination with AKTi significantly inhibits growth of patient-derived xenografts resistant to combined CDK4/6i and fulvestrant. Finally, high phospho-AKT levels in metastasis of breast cancer patients treated with a combination of CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy correlates with shorter progression-free survival.

Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

Somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have emerged as promising agents for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS-mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. Here, we demonstrate that the selective pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. Our analysis using RNAi and TAK-632 in preclinical models reveals that the MAPK pathway of NRAS-mutated melanoma cells is highly dependent on RAF. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. As a result, TAK-632 demonstrates potent antiproliferative effects both on NRAS-mutated melanoma cells and BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through NRAS mutation or BRAF truncation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor TAK-733 exhibits synergistic antiproliferative effects on these cells. Our findings characterize the unique features of TAK-632 as a pan-RAF inhibitor and provide rationale for its further investigation in NRAS-mutated melanoma and a subset of BRAF-mutated melanomas refractory to BRAF inhibitors.

The development of acquired resistance is inevitable due to the signaling pathway rewiring. Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of these cells. Our study reveals that mTOR activation is essential for drug resistance of melanoma to MAPK inhibitors, and provides insight into the rewiring of the signaling networks in CR melanoma.","2021-07-24","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Melanoma Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;melanoma","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EIVUJNAA/Wang et al. - 2021 - Targeting mTOR signaling overcomes acquired resist.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JBTR26XA/s41388-021-01911-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significantly, nilotinib (2nd generation ABL1/2 inhibitor) reverses resistance, in vivo, causing prolonged regression of resistant tumors, and also, prevents BRAFi/MEKi resistance from developing in the first place.

Robust ERK1/2 activation following MEKi withdrawal drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, selecting against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and reversal of MEKi resistance. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, validating intermittent dosing to forestall resistance.

HSF1 is also involved in chemoresistance, and several studies have demonstrated the relationship between HSF1 and MDR1 but without any consistent results. Paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells showed higher expression of MDR1 and HSF1. Depletion of HSF1 decreased mdr1 expression at mRNA level, and HSF1 directly interacted with the promoter site of mdr1, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator of MDR1. Phosphorylation of Ser303/307, which was involved in protein stability of HSF1 by FBXW7-mediated degradation, was found to be important for transcriptional activation of mdr1. Drug-resistant cells showed decreased expression of FBXW7, which was mediated by the activation of ERK1/2, thus indicating that over-activation of ERK1/2 in drug-resistant cells decreased FBXW7 protein stability, which finally inhibited protein degradation of pHSF1 at Ser303/307. There was a positive correlation between immunofluorescence data of pHSF1 at Ser303/307 and MDR1 in carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors and human lung cancers. These findings identified the post-translational mechanisms of HSF1 transcription in MDR1 regulation of drug resistance development.","2020-05-26","2021-08-30 08:42:05","2021-08-30 08:42:05","2021-08-30 08:42:05","1-14","","5","11","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Phosphorylation Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;phosphorylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/M7598E8Y/Mun et al. - 2020 - Decreased expression of FBXW7 by ERK12 activation.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6HSQ86NC/s41419-020-2600-3.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of Mdm2, which impedes Mdm2 autoubiquitination and degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization of Mdm2. MARCH7 also promotes Mdm2-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, MARCH7 is able to regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and tumorigenesis via a p53-dependent mechanism. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of Mdm2 and reveal MARCH7 as an important regulator of the Mdm2?p53 pathway.","2018-02-01","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","305-319","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IB4MFKRK/2018 - Regulation of the Mdm2–p53 pathway by the ubiquiti.pdf","","","MARCH7; Mdm2; p53; ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy activation and the development of hypoxic regions within the tumors are known to promote cancer cell resistance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy and hypoxia on the taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol induced apoptosis after 16 h of incubation, and that hypoxia protected MDA-MB-231 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. In parallel, taxol induced autophagy activation already after 2 h of incubation both under normoxia and hypoxia. Autophagy activation after taxol exposure was shown to be a protective mechanism against taxol-induced cell death both under normoxia and hypoxia. However, at longer incubation time, the autophagic process reached a saturation point under normoxia leading to cell death, whereas under hypoxia, autophagy flow still correctly took place allowing the cells to survive. Autophagy induction is induced after taxol exposure via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, which is more important in cells exposed to hypoxia. Taxol also induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and phosphorylation of its substrates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and BCL2-like 1 (BclXL) under normoxia and hypoxia very early after taxol exposure. Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation was decreased more importantly under hypoxia after long incubation time. The role of JNK in autophagy and apoptosis induction was studied using siRNAs. The results showed that JNK activation promotes resistance against taxol-induced apoptosis under normoxia and hypoxia without being involved in induction of autophagy. In conclusion, the resistance against taxol-induced cell death observed under hypoxia can be explained by a more effective autophagic flow activated via the classical mTOR pathway and by a mechanism involving JNK, which could be dependent on Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation but independent of JNK-induced autophagy activation.","2013-05","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","e638-e638","","5","4","","Cell Death Dis","Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells","","","","","","","en","2013 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Breast cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;breast-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/554QSFB4/Notte et al. - 2013 - Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDUUEBQY/cddis2013167.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction &gt;90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.</p>","2015-07-21","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YNHPDB6Z/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VMFKBSNI/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EGFR mutations identify lung cancer patients who can derive benefit from TKIs, but most patients develop resistance to the first-, second-, and third-generation drugs. To explore alternatives to such whack-a-mole strategies, we simulated in patient-derived xenograft models the situation of patients receiving first-line TKIs. Monotherapies comprising approved first-line TKIs were compared to combinations with antibodies specific to EGFR and HER2. We observed uniform and strong superiority of all drug combinations over the respective monotherapies. Prolonged treatments, high TKI dose, and specificity were essential for drug?drug cooperation. Blocking pathways essential for mitosis (e.g., FOXM1), along with downregulation of resistance-conferring receptors (e.g., AXL), might underlie drug cooperation. Thus, upfront treatments using combinations of TKIs and antibodies can prevent emergence of resistance and hence might replace the widely applied sequential treatments utilizing next-generation TKIs.","2021-04-09","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","e13144","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CYLCPIC2/2021 - Upfront admixing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors pr.pdf","","","EGFR TKIs; first-line therapy; mAbs; NSCLC; resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET.

ALW-II-41-27 was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291. Collectively, these data define a role for EPHA2 in the maintenance of cell survival of TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutant lung cancer and indicate that EPHA2 may serve as a useful therapeutic target in TKI-resistant tumors.

The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib represents the only systemic treatment option until today, and results from clinical trials with allosteric mTOR inhibitors were sobering. Since the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are frequently upregulated in HCC, we have analyzed the effects of AKT inhibitor MK-2206, MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) and mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055, given as single drugs or in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis of three HCC cell lines in vitro. We show that all three inhibitor combinations synergistically inhibit proliferation of the three HCC cell lines, with the strongest synergistic effect observed after vertical inhibition of AKT and mTORC1/2. We demonstrate that AKT kinase activity is restored 24h after blockade of mTORC1/2 by increased phosphorylation of T308, providing a rationale for combined targeting of AKT and mTOR inhibition in HCC. Our data suggest that a combination of inhibitors targeting those respective pathways may be a viable approach for future application in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","2015","2021-08-30 16:59:49","2021-08-30 16:59:49","","1195-1205","","12","6","","J Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26535060 PMCID: PMC4622849","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P93WE2J6/Ewald et al. - 2015 - Vertical Targeting of AKT and mTOR as Well as Dual.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535060","","mTOR; AKT; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MEK.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These EGFR-dependent tumors eventually become TKI resistant, and the common secondary T790M mutation accounts for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib. However, the key proapoptotic proteins involved in TKI-induced cell death and other secondary mutations involved in resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis and secondary resistant mutations that affect this process. Methods and Findings To study TKI-induced cell death and mechanisms of resistance, we used lung cancer cell lines (with or without EGFR mutations), Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with EGFR mutation constructs, and tumor samples from a gefitinib-resistant patient. Here we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only polypeptide BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11) correlated with gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. The T790M mutation blocked gefitinib-induced up-regulation of BIM and apoptosis. This blockade was overcome by the irreversible TKI CL-387,785. Knockdown of BIM by small interfering RNA was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, from a gefitinib-resistant patient carrying the activating L858R mutation, we identified a novel secondary resistant mutation, L747S in cis to the activating mutation, which attenuated the up-regulation of BIM and reduced apoptosis. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that BIM is involved in TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells and that both attenuation of the up-regulation of BIM and resistance to gefitinib-induced apoptosis are seen in models that contain the common EGFR T790M and the novel L747S secondary resistance mutations. These findings also suggest that induction of BIM may have a role in the treatment of TKI-resistant tumors.","2007-10-30","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","e315","","10","4","","PLOS Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/F6XYEEGA/Costa et al. - 2007 - BIM Mediates EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induce.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; EGFR signaling; Lung and intrathoracic tumors; Mutation detection; Non-small cell lung cancer; Transfection; Tyrosine kinases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously shown EGFR mutations occur in >70% of lung adenocarcinoma from nonsmokers in our population with a complex mutational profile, including 13% of EGFR double mutations. In this study, we investigated the in vitro gefitinib response of four EGFR double mutants identified in untreated patients, including Q787R+L858R, E709A+G719C, T790M+L858R, and H870R+L858R. The phosphorylation profiles of EGFR and downstream effectors AKT, STAT3/5, and ERK1/2 were compared by immunoblot analyses among the single and double mutants transfected into H358 cells. Results showed that mutants responded to in vitro gefitinib treatment with different sensitivities. The G719C and L858R single mutants showed the highest gefitinib sensitivity compared with the corresponding coexisting single mutants E709A, Q787R, H870R, and T790M. The double mutants E709A+G719C, Q787R+L858R, and H870R+L858R showed attenuated responses to gefitinib in the EGFR and downstream effector phosphorylation profiles compared with G719C or L858R alone. T790M+L858R showed strong resistance to gefitinib. Clinically, the patient whose tumor contained H870R+L858R showed tumor stabilization by 250 mg oral gefitinib daily but cerebral metastasis developed 6 months later. Correlation with the in vitro phosphorylation profile of H870R+L858R suggested that treatment failure was probably due to inadequate suppression of EGFR signaling by the drug level attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid at the given oral dosage.

Consistently, disruption of wild-type EGFR leads to suppression of HER2/HER3, while mutant EGFR ablation or resistance to TKIs increases HER2/HER3 expression, compensating for EGFR loss. Furthermore, HER2/HER3 nuclear translocation mediates overexpression of cyclin D1, leading to tumor cell survival and drug resistance. Cyclin D1/CDK4/6 inhibition resensitizes erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells to erlotinib.

Here, we present a dual mechanism of AKT regulation by the ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1). We show that in cells expressing high levels of EGFR, ERRF1 inhibits growth and enhances responses to chemotherapy. This is mediated in part through the negative regulation of AKT signaling by direct ERRFI1-dependent inhibition of EGFR. In cells expressing low levels of EGFR, ERRFI1 positively modulates AKT signaling by interfering with the interaction of the inactivating phosphatase PHLPP with AKT, thereby promoting cell growth and chemotherapy desensitization. These observations broaden our understanding of chemotherapy response and have important implications for the selection of targeted therapies in a cell context-dependent manner. EGFR inhibition can only sensitize EGFR-high cells for chemotherapy, while AKT inhibition increases chemosensitivity in EGFR-low cells. By understanding these mechanisms, we can take advantage of the cellular context to individualize antineoplastic therapy. Finally, our data also suggest targeting of EFFRI1 in EGFR-low cancer as a promising therapeutic approach.","2018-03-01","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","e44767","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A3FZ2EF4/2018 - Differential roles of ERRFI1 in EGFR and AKT pathw.pdf","","","AKT; AKT inhibitor; EGFR; ERRFI1; PHLPP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore, an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-α, E545K, and H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses, suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-α.

We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner.

This study revealed that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) contributes to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells. We observed that KLF4 was overexpressed in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells and tissues. Knockdown of KLF4 increased tumorigenic properties in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines without c-Met overexpression, but it reduced tumorigenic properties and increased gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with c-Met overexpression, whereas overexpression of KLF4 reduced gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that KLF4 contributed to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins under gefitinib treatment and activating the c-Met/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing the inhibition of β-catenin on phosphorylation of c-Met to prevent blockade by gefitinib.

EPH receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and modulate a diverse range of developmental processes and human diseases. However, the role of C1GALT1 in the signaling of EPH receptors remains largely overlooked. Here, we showed that C1GALT1 high expression in gastric adenocarcinomas correlated with adverse clinicopathologic features and is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. Silencing or loss of C1GALT1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, as well as increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil in AGS and MKN45 cells. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis showed that C1GALT1 depletion suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 induced by soluble Ephrin A1-Fc. O-glycans on EPHA2 were modified by C1GALT1 and both S277A and T429A mutants, which are O-glycosites on EPHA2, dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Y588, suggesting that not only overall O-glycan structures but also site-specific O-glycosylation can regulate EPHA2 activity. Furthermore, depletion of C1GALT1 decreased Ephrin A1-Fc induced migration and reduced Ephrin A1 binding to cell surfaces. The effects of C1GALT1 knockdown or knockout on cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo were phenocopied by EPHA2 knockdown in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that C1GALT1 promotes phosphorylation of EPHA2 and enhances soluble Ephrin A1-mediated migration primarily by modifying EPHA2 O-glycosylation.

Heterogeneity along the EMT spectrum is observed between and within tumors. To develop effective therapeutics, a mechanistic understanding of how EMT affects the molecular requirements for proliferation is needed. We found that although cells use phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) for proliferation in both the epithelial and mesenchymal states, EMT rewires the mechanism of PI3K pathway activation. In epithelial cells, autocrine ERBB3 activation maintains PI3K signaling, whereas after EMT, downregulation of ERBB3 disrupts autocrine signaling to PI3K. Loss of ERBB3 leads to reduced serum-independent proliferation after EMT that can be rescued through reactivation of PI3K by enhanced signaling from p110α, ERBB3 reexpression, or growth factor stimulation. In vivo, we demonstrate that PIK3CA expression is upregulated in mesenchymal tumors with low levels of ERBB3. This study defines how ERBB3 downregulation after EMT affects PI3K-dependent proliferation. Significance: This study describes a mechanism through which EMT transition alters the proliferative potential of cells by modulating ERBB3 expression. Furthermore, it demonstrates the potential for multiple molecular routes to drive proliferation in different cell states, illustrating how changes in EMT status can rewire signaling upstream of cell proliferation.

SH003-mediated ER stress inhibits G9a, a histone methyltransferase, by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation and activates autophagy, indicating to the dissociation of Beclin-1 and autophagy initiation from Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex. However, the inhibition of PERK and CHOP inhibited SH003-induced cell death and autophagy activation. Moreover, targeting autophagy using specific siRNAs of LC3B or p62 or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA also inhibited SH003-induced cell death in GC. Interestingly, SH003 induces BNIP3-mediated autophagic cell death under hypoxia than normoxia in GC.

MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2’s predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS’s unique effector specificity for SHOC2–PP1.

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/W57Z9ILH/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular underpinnings of the selective participation of TBK1 in a myriad of additional cell biological systems in normal and pathophysiologic contexts remain poorly understood. To elucidate the context-selective role of TBK1 in cancer cell survival, we employed a combination of broad-scale chemogenomic and interactome discovery strategies to generate data-driven mechanism-of-action hypotheses. This approach uncovered evidence that TBK1 supports AKT/mTORC1 pathway activation and function through direct modulation of multiple pathway components acting both upstream and downstream of the mTOR kinase itself. Furthermore, we identified distinct molecular features in which mesenchymal, Ras-mutant lung cancer is acutely dependent on TBK1-mediated support of AKT/mTORC1 pathway activation for survival. <i>Cancer Res; 77(18); 5077–94. ©2017 AACR</i>.</p>","2017-09-15","2021-08-31 17:34:44","2021-09-07 20:49:38","2021-08-31 17:34:44","5077-5094","","18","77","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","cancerres-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Therapeutics, Targets, and Chemical Biology PMID: 28716898","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J5KYQ4JH/Cooper et al. - 2017 - TBK1 Provides Context-Selective Support of the Act.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TFL646HV/5077.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28716898","_company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, Akt signaling has been linked to resistance to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in sarcoma, further demonstrating the role of Akt in tumor survival. This suggests targeting components of the PI3K/Akt pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the in vitro activity of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Buparlisib inhibited activation of Akt and signaling molecules downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) in Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Anti-proliferative effects were observed in both anchorage dependent and independent conditions and apoptosis was induced within 24 hours of drug treatment. Buparlisib demonstrated cytotoxicity as a single agent, but was found to be more effective when used in combination. Synergy was observed when buparlisib was combined with the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The addition of NVP-AEW541 also further reduced phospho-Akt levels and more potently induced apoptosis compared to buparlisib treatment alone. Additionally, the combination of buparlisib with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib resulted in synergy in sarcoma cell lines possessing MAPK pathway mutations. Taken together, these data indicate buparlisib could be a novel therapy for the treatment of pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas.","2015-09-24","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","e0133610","","9","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7G52CFGJ/Anderson et al. - 2015 - Evaluation of In Vitro Activity of the Class I PI3.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancers and neoplasms; Drug therapy; Ewing sarcoma; Immunoblot analysis; MAPK signaling cascades; Pediatrics; Sarcoma cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, is importantly recognized as intracellular remodeling mechanism of cellular organelles during muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation. Treatment with MitoQ or rapamycin impaired both phosphorylation of ULK1 and expression of Atg proteins.

Here, we show that activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway tightly regulates PD-L1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Both oncogenic and IFNγ-mediated induction of PD-L1 was dependent on mTOR. In human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, membranous expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with mTOR activation. These data suggest that oncogenic activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway promotes immune escape by driving expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer where an mTOR inhibitor combined with a PD-1 antibody decreased tumor growth, increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, and decreased regulatory T cells.

In contrast, tumor cells expressing both CDK4 and CDK6 have increased reliance on CDK6 to ensure cell cycle progression. We discovered that CDK4/6is and CDK4/6 degraders potently bind and inhibit CDK6 selectively in tumors in which CDK6 is highly thermo-unstable and strongly associated with the HSP90–CDC37 complex. In contrast, CDK4/6is and CDK4/6 degraders are ineffective in antagonizing tumor cells expressing thermostable CDK6, due to their weaker binding to CDK6 in these cells.

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational–experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to osmotic stress, as well as by signals acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For proper adaptation, the action of these kinases must be coordinated. To identify second messengers of stress adaptation, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics profiling analysis, quantifying nearly 300 metabolites in the yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the MAPK Hog1. Ectopic addition of these BCAA derivatives promotes phosphorylation of the G protein α subunit and dampens G protein-dependent transcription, similar to that seen in response to osmotic stress. Conversely, genetic ablation of Hog1 activity or the BCAA-regulatory enzymes leads to diminished phosphorylation of Gα and increased transcription.

Here we show that vesicular RANK, which is secreted from the maturing osteoclasts, binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signalling, which activates Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). The proline-rich motif in the RANKL cytoplasmic tail is required for reverse signalling, and a RANKL(Pro29Ala) point mutation reduces activation of the reverse signalling pathway. The coupling of bone resorption and formation is disrupted in RANKL(Pro29Ala) mutant mice, indicating that osteoblastic RANKL functions as a coupling signal acceptor that recognizes vesicular RANK. RANKL reverse signalling is therefore a potential pharmacological target for avoiding the reduced bone formation associated with inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.","2018-09","2021-09-11 19:05:39","2021-09-11 19:05:44","2021-09-11 19:05:39","195-200","","7722","561","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7722 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Antibody fragment therapy;Extracellular signalling molecules;Osteoporosis Subject_term_id: antibody-fragment-therapy;extracellular-signalling-molecules;osteoporosis","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VT843WNK/Ikebuchi et al. - 2018 - Coupling of bone resorption and formation by RANKL.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ82H54G/s41586-018-0482-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around half of all breast cancers with HER2 overexpression co-express hormone receptors (HR) such as those for estrogen and progesterone. Aberrant signaling through HER2 and other members of the HER-family mediates endocrine-resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer. On the other hand, ERα co-expression has been shown to attenuate the efficiency of anti-HER2 therapies. These findings indicate that HER2 and ERα synergize to escape from both anti-ERα and anti-HER2-targeted therapies. Rationally designed clinical trials that combine endocrine therapy with anti-HER2 agents to interfere with HER2/ERα cross-talk have been conducted. However, the outcome of these trials suggests that novel therapeutic approaches are needed to further improve inhibition of HER2 and other HER-family members in conjunction with a more efficient ERα blockade. Here, we demonstrate that carfilzomib and bortezomib stabilize the HER2-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 leading to decreased HER2 autophosphorylation, reduced HER2 activity and subsequently attenuated activation of the PI3K/Akt-pathway, together with blockade of ERα expression. We further observed that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) reverse autophosphorylation and thereby inhibit the activity of constitutively active mutant HER2. We also demonstrate that PIs cause cell death in lapatinib and endocrine-resistant HER2+/ER+ breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that PIs might have the potential to improve the management of HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patients by efficiently disrupting the bi-directional HER2/ERα cross-talk.","2017-09-01","2021-09-11 19:25:04","2021-09-11 19:25:06","2021-09-11 19:25:04","72281-72301","","42","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","eng","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 29069787 PMCID: PMC5641130","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RPJRXRI9/Thaler et al. - 2017 - Proteasome inhibitors prevent bi-directional HER2.pdf","","","Breast Cancer Therapy; Er+/her2+ Breast Cancer; Proteasome inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrate, using several human and mouse models of PDACs, rapid acquisition of tumor resistance in response to targeting KRAS or MEK, associated with integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-mediated increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 component Rictor, and AKT. Although inhibition of mTORC1/2 results in a compensatory increase in ERK phosphorylation, combinatorial treatment of PDAC cells with either KRAS (G12C) or MEK inhibitors, together with mTORC1/2 inhibitors, results in synergistic cytotoxicity and cell death reflected by inhibition of pERK and pRictor/pAKT and of downstream regulators of protein synthesis and cell survival. Relative to single agents alone, this combination leads to durable inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic progression in vivo and increased survival. We have identified an effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, which can be applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations.","2020-11-17","2021-09-11 21:34:59","2021-09-11 21:35:03","","100131","","8","1","","Cell Rep Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33294856 PMCID: PMC7691443","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DZKSHWGF/Brown et al. - 2020 - Overcoming Adaptive Resistance to KRAS and MEK Inh.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294856","","signal transduction; acquired resistance; AMG 510; cellular toxicity; KRAS; PDAC; protein translation; tumor regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation by most RTKs and might provide a common resistance node. We found that combining the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 with a MEKi inhibited the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. PTPN11 knockdown/MEKi treatment had similar effects, whereas expressing SHP099 binding–defective PTPN11 mutants conferred resistance, demonstrating that SHP099 is on-target. SHP099/trametinib was highly efficacious in xenograft and/or genetically engineered models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, lung, and ovarian cancers and in wild-type RAS-expressing triple-negative breast cancer. SHP099 inhibited activation of KRAS mutants with residual GTPase activity, impeded SOS/RAS/MEK/ERK1/2 reactivation in response to MEKi, and blocked ERK1/2-dependent transcriptional programs. We conclude that SHP099/MEKi combinations could have therapeutic utility in multiple malignancies.

By searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2. DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38α MAPK. The activated S6K1 forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response and likely in tumorigenesis.

How cancer cells bypass inhibition to prevent maximal response to therapy is not understood. Because KRAS(G12C) cycles between an active and inactive conformation4–6, and the inhibitors bind only to the latter, we tested whether isogenic cell populations respond in a non-uniform manner by studying the effect of treatment at a single-cell resolution. Here we report that, shortly after treatment, some cancer cells are sequestered in a quiescent state with low KRAS activity, whereas others bypass this effect to resume proliferation. This rapid divergent response occurs because some quiescent cells produce new KRAS(G12C) in response to suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase output. New KRAS(G12C) is maintained in its active, drug-insensitive state by epidermal growth factor receptor and aurora kinase signalling. Cells without these adaptive changes—or cells in which these changes are pharmacologically inhibited—remain sensitive to drug treatment, because new KRAS(G12C) is either not available or exists in its inactive, drug-sensitive state. The direct targeting of KRAS oncoproteins has been a longstanding objective in precision oncology. Our study uncovers a flexible non-uniform fitness mechanism that enables groups of cells within a population to rapidly bypass the effect of treatment.

In vitro, sensitivity of KRAS-mutant cells toward the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, is not apparent when cells are grown on plastic in 2D monolayer, but is revealed when cells are grown as 3D multicellular spheroids. This antitumor activity is also observed in vivo in mouse models. Interrogation of the MAPK pathway in SHP099-treated KRAS-mutant cancer models demonstrated similar modulation of p-ERK and DUSP6 transcripts in 2D, 3D, and in vivo, suggesting a MAPK pathway–dependent mechanism and possible non-MAPK pathway–dependent mechanisms in tumor cells or tumor microenvironment for the in vivo efficacy. For the KRASG12C MIAPaCa-2 model, we demonstrate that the efficacy is cancer cell intrinsic as there is minimal antiangiogenic activity by SHP099, and the effects of SHP099 is recapitulated by genetic depletion of SHP2 in cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP099 efficacy in KRAS-mutant models can be recapitulated with RTK inhibitors, suggesting RTK activity is responsible for the SHP2 activation.

To identify differential therapeutic sensitivities between epithelial and mesenchymal lung tumors, we performed in vivo small hairpin RNA screens, proteomic profiling, and analysis of patient tumor datasets, which revealed an inverse correlation between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling dependency and a zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)-regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies determined that MAPK signaling dependency in epithelial lung cancer cells is due to the scaffold protein interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD), which is directly repressed by ZEB1. Lung tumors in multiple Kras mutant murine models with increased ZEB1 displayed low IL17RD expression, accompanied by MAPK-independent tumor growth and therapeutic resistance to MEK inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 function with miR-200 expression or the histone deacetylase inhibitor mocetinostat sensitized resistant cancer cells to MEK inhibition and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth, showing a promising combinatorial treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. In human lung tumor samples, high ZEB1 and low IL17RD expression correlated with low MAPK signaling, presenting potential markers that predict patient response to MEK inhibitors.","2019-03-13","2021-09-11 22:15:24","2021-09-11 22:15:24","","eaaq1238","","483","11","","Sci Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30867319 PMCID: PMC6878763","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/372MF6DA/Peng et al. - 2019 - ZEB1 suppression sensitizes KRAS mutant cancers to.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867319","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Humans; Mice; Benzamides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial Cells; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mesoderm; MicroRNAs; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Mutation; Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Pyrimidines; Receptors, Interleukin-17; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These were PDX models harboring primary and secondary KIT and additional mutations; KIT exon 11 (p.Y570_L576del), KIT exon 17 (p.D816E), and PTEN (p.T321fs) mutations in GIST-RX1 from a patient who was unresponsive to imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib, and KIT exon 11 (p.K550_splice) and KIT exon 14 (p.T670I) mutations in GIST-RX2 and KIT exon 9 (p.502_503insYA) and KIT exon 17 (p.D820E) mutations in GIST-RX4 from patients with imatinib and imatinib/sunitinib resistance, respectively. The histological features and mutation statuses of GIST PDXs were consistent with those of the original patient tumors, and the models showed TKI sensitivity comparable to clinical responses. Imatinib inhibited the KIT pathway in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 but not GIST-RX1, RX2, and RX4. These GIST PDX models will be useful for studying TKI resistance mechanisms and evaluating novel targeted agents in GIST.","2017-09-11","2021-09-11 23:13:19","2021-09-11 23:13:26","","","","","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/C2ZP8EQL/Na et al. - 2017 - Establishment and characterization of patient-deri.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319657318_Establishment_and_characterization_of_patient-derived_xenograft_models_of_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_resistant_to_standard_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CK6 did not result in significant anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects in any of the GIST models, and moreover, CK6 did not induce a remarkable inhibition of KIT activation. Furthermore, no synergistic effect of combining CK6 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was observed. Conversely, in certain GIST xenografts, anti-tumor effects seemed to be inferior under combination treatment compared to single-agent TKI treatment. In the GIST xenografts tested, the anti-tumor efficacy of CK6 was limited. No synergy was observed on combination of CK6 with TKIs in these GIST models.

The development of effective salvage treatments is complicated by the heterogeneity of KIT secondary resistance mutations. Recently, additional mutations that independently activate KIT-downstream signaling have been found in pretreated patients—adding further complexity to the scope of resistance. We collected genotyping data for KIT from tumor samples of pretreated GIST, providing a representative overview on the distribution and incidence of secondary KIT mutations (n = 80). Analyzing next-generation sequencing data of 109 GIST, we found that 18% carried mutations in KIT-downstream signaling intermediates (NF1/2, PTEN, RAS, PIK3CA, TSC1/2, AKT, BRAF) potentially mediating resistance to KIT inhibitors. Notably, we found no apparent other driver mutations in refractory cases that were analyzed by whole exome/genome sequencing (13/109). Using CRISPR/Cas9 methods, we generated a panel of GIST cell lines harboring mutations in KIT, PTEN, KRAS, NF1, and TSC2. We utilized this panel to evaluate sapanisertib, a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, as a salvage strategy. Sapanisertib had potent antiproliferative effects in all cell lines, including those with KIT-downstream mutations. Combinations with KIT or MEK inhibitors completely abrogated GIST-survival signaling and displayed synergistic effects. Our isogenic cell line panel closely approximates the genetic heterogeneity of resistance observed in heavily pretreated patients with GIST. With the clinical development of novel, broad spectrum KIT inhibitors, emergence of non-KIT–related resistance may require combination treatments with inhibitors of KIT-downstream signaling such as mTOR or MEK.","2019-11-01","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:52","1985-1996","","11","18","","Mol Cancer Ther","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mct-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Small Molecule Therapeutics PMID: 31308077","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CSPSM55N/Mühlenberg et al. - 2019 - KIT-Dependent and KIT-Independent Genomic Heteroge.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in GISTs and impact KIT expression. Little is known though on KIT-independent targets of KIT-regulating mRNAs. We sought to investigate how miR-494 inhibits GIST proliferation and to identify novel target gene. We used microarray-based gene expression analyses to identify pathways and target genes affected by miR-494. The expressional relationship between survivin and miR-494 was determined in 35 GIST tissues. Cell proliferation assay, FACS analysis, colony formation assay, promoter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) were performed to clarify the roles of survivin in GIST progression. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that miR-494 inhibited GISTs by affecting multiple genes in the cell cycle pathway. Survivin (BIRC5) was a key target of miR-494, and its expression showed an inverse correlation with miR-494 expression in 35 GIST tissues (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = −0.418, p = 0.012). Downregulation of survivin inhibited proliferation and colony formation, and resulted in cell cycle alteration. Induced survivin overexpression relieved miR-494-mediated inhibition of GIST progression. Targeting PI3K effectively suppressed proliferation of GISTs with downregulation of survivin. Survivin also regulated KIT expression at the transcription level. Immunohistochemical analysis using 113 GISTs revealed that survivin expression was significantly correlated with overall survival of GIST patients (p = 0.004). Our findings indicated that miR-494 synergistically suppressed GISTs by concomitantly targeting survivin and KIT.","2018","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2080-2093","","10","142","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.31235","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8ABEBK4F/Yun et al. - 2018 - Survivin is a novel transcription regulator of KIT.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U3WCEKVH/ijc.html","","","gastrointestinal stromal tumor; KIT; miR-494; survivin; vertical blockade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the ERBB2 receptor have recently been reported in breast cancer at diagnosis and also in gastric, colorectal and lung cancer. These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002. Conclusions/Significance Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations. Irreversible ERBB2 inhibitors may offer alternative treatment options for breast cancer and other solid tumor patients harbouring lapatinib resistance mutations. In addition, these inhibitors may be of interest in the scenario of secondary lapatinib resistance.","2011-10-28","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","e26760","","10","6","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JIQCFJFV/Kancha et al. - 2011 - Differential Sensitivity of ERBB2 Kinase Domain Mu.pdf","","","Cancer treatment; Breast cancer; Binding analysis; Cell binding assay; Crystal structure; Gastric cancer; Insertion mutation; Point mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CYH33 potently restrained tumor growth in mice bearing human breast cancer cell xenografts and in R26-Pik3caH1047R;MMTV-Cre transgenic mice. CYH33 significantly inhibited proliferation of a panel of human breast cancer cells, while diversity in sensitivity has been observed. Cells harboring activating PIK3CA mutation, amplified HER2 were more responsive to CYH33 than their counterparts. Besides, cells in HER2-enriched or luminal subtype were more sensitive to CYH33 than basal-like breast cancer. Sensitivity to CYH33 has been further revealed to be associated with induction of G1 phase arrest and simultaneous inhibition of Akt and ERK. Sensitivity of patient-derived xenograft to CYH33 was also positively correlated with decrease in phosphorylated ERK. Taken together, CYH33 is a promising PI3Kα inhibitor for breast cancer treatment and decrease in ERK phosphorylation may indicate its efficacy, which provides useful clues for rational design of the ongoing clinical trials.","2018-10-01","2021-09-11 23:20:29","2021-09-11 23:20:29","2021-09-11 23:20:29","273-282","","","433","","Cancer Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","HER2; Akt; Patient-derived xenograft (PDX)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both caused inhibition of AKT, relief of feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, and growth arrest. However, only the PI3K inhibitors caused rapid induction of cell death. In seeking a mechanism for this phenomenon, we found that PI3K inhibition, but not AKT inhibition, causes rapid inhibition of wild-type RAS and of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Inhibition of RAS–ERK signaling is transient, rebounding a few hours after drug addition, and is required for rapid induction of apoptosis. Combined MEK and AKT inhibition also promotes cell death, and in murine models of HER2+ cancer, either pulsatile PI3K inhibition or combined MEK and AKT inhibition causes tumor regression. We conclude that PI3K is upstream of RAS and AKT and that pulsatile inhibition of both pathways is sufficient for effective antitumor activity. Significance: We show that the RAS–ERK pathway is a key downstream effector pathway of oncogenic PI3K. Coordinate downregulation of AKT and ERK is necessary for induction of apoptosis and antitumor activity and can be accomplished with pulsatile dosing, which will likely decrease toxicity and allow administration of therapeutic doses.

We sought to discover predictive biomarker for the efficacy of BYL719 by dissecting the proliferative signaling pathway mediated by PI3K in breast cancer. BYL719 concurrently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in PIK3CA-mutated human breast cancer cells. PI3K-regulated ERK phosphorylation was independent of canonical PDK1/AKT/mTOR pathway, while it was associated with RAF/MEK. Hyper-activation of EGFR or RAS abrogated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by BYL719. Furthermore, hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, c-MET, FGFR and HER3 but not IGF-1R restored ERK phosphorylation and cell viability suppressed by BYL719, suggesting the discriminative functions of RTKs in cell signaling and proliferation. By profiling 22 breast cancer cell lines, we found that BYL719 was more potent in cell lines where phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK was attenuated than those where only AKT phosphorylation was inhibited. The potency of BYL719 was further found to be significantly correlated with the expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer cells. Specifically, overexpression of EGFR, c-MET and/or FGFR1 forecasted resistance, while overexpression of IGF-1R and/or HER2 predicted sensitivity to BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Similar correlation between BYL719 efficacy and expression profile of RTKs was found in patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer. Thus, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 contributes to its antitumor efficacy and is determined by the converged signaling from RTKs. The expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer tissue could be potentially developed as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors.","2017","2021-09-11 23:22:25","2021-09-11 23:22:30","2021-09-11 23:22:25","974-986","","4","7","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HDGXBRNF/Xu et al. - 2017 - Integration of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Determine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intriguingly, this function of KDM4B on UPR requires its demethylase activity but is independent of its canonical role in histone modification, and acts through its cytoplasmic interaction with eIF2α, a crucial component of UPR signaling, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of this component.

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:27","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/274AZF92/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PSGJGQVZ/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, potential molecular mechanisms by which resistance to this class of drugs occurs have not been investigated. Parsaclisib (INCB050465) is a potent and selective next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitor that differs in structure from first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors and has shown encouraging anti–B-cell tumor activity and reduced hepatotoxicity in phase 1/2 clinical studies. Here, we present preclinical data demonstrating parsaclisib as a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ with over 1000-fold selectivity against other class 1 PI3K isozymes. Parsaclisib directly blocks PI3K signaling–mediated cell proliferation in B-cell lines in vitro and in vivo and indirectly controls tumor growth by lessening immunosuppression through regulatory T-cell inhibition in a syngeneic lymphoma model. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines overexpressing MYC were insensitive to proliferation blockade via PI3Kδ signaling inhibition by parsaclisib, but their proliferative activities were reduced by suppression of MYC gene transcription. Molecular structure analysis of the first- and next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors combined with clinical observation suggests that hepatotoxicity seen with the first-generation inhibitors could result from a structure-related off-target effect. Parsaclisib is currently being evaluated in multiple phase 2 clinical trials as a therapy against various hematologic malignancies of B-cell origin (NCT03126019, NCT02998476, NCT03235544, NCT03144674, and NCT02018861). SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The preclinical properties described here provide the mechanism of action and support clinical investigations of parsaclisib as a therapy for B-cell malignancies. MYC overexpression was identified as a resistance mechanism to parsaclisib in DLBCL cells, which may be useful in guiding further translational studies for the selection of patients with DLBCL who might benefit from PI3Kδ inhibitor treatment in future trials. Hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors may be an off-target effect of that class of compounds.","2020-07-01","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","211-222","","1","374","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 by The Author(s).

PI3Kδ has been validated as a promising target for cancer therapy, and specific PI3Kδ inhibitors were approved for clinical practice. However, the substantial toxicity and relatively low efficacy as a monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) limit their clinical use. In this study, we described a novel PI3Kδ inhibitor SAF-248, which exhibited high selectivity for PI3Kδ (IC50 = 30.6 nM) over other PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels, while sparing most of the other human protein kinases in the kinome profiling. SAF-248 exhibited superior antiproliferative activity against 27 human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines compared with the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib. In particular, SAF-248 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of seven DLBCL cell lines (with GI50 values < 1 μM in 5 DLBCL cell lines). We demonstrated that SAF-248 concentration-dependently blocked PI3K signaling followed by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL KARPAS-422, Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Its activity against the DLBCL cells was negatively correlated to the protein level of PI3Kα. Oral administration of SAF-248 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Activation of mTORC1, MYC and JAK/STAT signaling was observed upon prolonged treatment and co-targeting these pathways would potentiate the activity of SAF-248. Taken together, SAF-248 is a promising selective PI3Kδ inhibitor for the treatment of DLBCL and rational drug combination would further improve its efficacy.","2021-03-29","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","1-11","","","","","Acta Pharmacol Sin","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to CPS and SIMM","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4 inhibitors for PEL.","2016-04-01","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","1797-1810","","14","35","","Oncogene","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 26119939 PMCID: PMC4486341","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YFSGJWJW/Gopalakrishnan et al. - 2016 - Immunomodulatory drugs target IKZF1-IRF4-MYC axis .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes.

However, little is known about the effect of sauchinone on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of sauchinone and the underlying mechanism using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model. Sauchinone markedly suppressed FcεRI-mediated activation of positive signaling mediators, including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), phospholipase C (PLC)γ, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Akt, IκB kinase (IKK), and intracellular Ca2+, and increased the activation of negative signaling mediators, including liver kinase B (LKB)1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. Interestingly, sauchinone increased the interaction between SHP-1 and Syk. Consequently, sauchinone significantly suppressed FcεRI-mediated BMMC degranulation and synthesis of eicosanoids and cytokines. These inhibitory effects of sauchinone were diminished in BMMCs treated with siRNAs targeting LKB1, AMPKα2, or SHP-1, and in BMMCs isolated from AMPKα2-deficient mice. In addition, administration of sauchinone markedly suppressed the IgE-mediated PCA reaction in wild-type mice, and this inhibitory effect was significantly reduced in AMPKα2−/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that sauchinone suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis through modulation of the LKB1/AMPK and SHP-1/Syk pathways. Therefore, sauchinone might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.","2019-09-01","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","105702","","","74","","International Immunopharmacology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; Allergy; Mast cell; Sauchinone; Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show here that suckling-weaning and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the glucagon/insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK. Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion under limited-glucose conditions, whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both insulin and glucagon induced AMPKα phosphorylation at its Ser485/491 residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic energy charge.

Here, using rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model, we found that DHA reduced cell proliferation and viability in RMS cells, but not those in normal cells, which was associated with inhibition of mTORC1. Mechanistically, DHA did not bind to mTOR or FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12). In addition, DHA neither inhibited insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (Erk1/2), nor activated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the cells. Rather, DHA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK, ectopic expression dominant negative or kinase-dead AMPK, or knockdown of AMPKa attenuated the inhibitory effect of DHA on mTORC1 in the cells. Additionally, DHA was able to induce dissociation of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor) from mTOR and inhibit mTORC1 activity. Moreover, treatment with artesunate, a prodrug of DHA, dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and concurrently activated AMPK and suppressed mTORC1 in RMS xenografts.

Here, we show that curcumin concentration- and time-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and their downstream substrates in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and this inhibitory effect acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or disruption of TSC1-TSC2 complex by small interfering RNA or gene knockout only partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream signaling, indicating that they are not the primary effectors of curcumin-mediated inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition of these kinases failed to rescue the inhibition by curcumin.

Endogenous Sestrins maintain insulin-dependent AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation during high-fat diet–induced obesity, and overexpressed Sestrins activate AKT in various cell types, including liver and skeletal muscle cells. Although Sestrin-mediated AKT activation improves metabolic parameters, the mechanistic details underlying such improvement remain elusive. Here, we investigated how Sestrin2, the Sestrin homolog highly expressed in liver, induces strong AKT activation. We found that two known targets of Sestrin2, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, are not required for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Rather, phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, kinases upstream of AKT, were essential for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Among these kinases, mTORC2 catalytic activity was strongly up-regulated upon Sestrin2 overexpression in an <i>in vitro</i> kinase assay, indicating that mTORC2 may represent the major link between Sestrin2 and AKT. As reported previously, Sestrin2 interacted with mTORC2; however, we found here that this interaction occurs indirectly through GATOR2, a pentameric protein complex that directly interacts with Sestrin2. Deleting or silencing WDR24 (WD repeat domain 24), the GATOR2 component essential for the Sestrin2–GATOR2 interaction, or WDR59, the GATOR2 component essential for the GATOR2–mTORC2 interaction, completely ablated Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. We also noted that Sestrin2 also directly binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT and induces AKT translocation to the plasma membrane.

The cellular energy sensor and regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was suggested as a putative mediator of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, the leading anthracycline drug, by our earlier work. Here, we study the interference of doxorubicin with AMPK signalling and potentially involved mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of doxorubicin on cell signalling are studied in isolated Langendorff-perfused Wistar rat hearts and in hearts from doxorubicin-treated Wistar rats. In both models, doxorubicin induces energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress. Despite energy depletion and unaffected AMPK upstream signalling, doxorubicin does not activate the AMPK pathway and even reduces basal phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In contrast, oxidative and genotoxic stress do activate pro-survival mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways, the latter via DNA-dependent protein kinase activation triggered by DNA damage. Combined inhibition of AMPK and activation of Akt and MAPK lead to activation of growth-stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the doxorubicin-challenged heart, a combined energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress elicits a specific, hierarchical response where AMPK is inhibited at least partially by the known negative cross-talk with Akt and MAPK pathways, largely triggered by DNA damage signalling. Although such signalling can be protective, e.g. by limiting apoptosis, it primarily induces a negative feedback that increases cellular energy deficits, and via activation of mTOR signalling, it also contributes to the pathological cardiac phenotype in chronic doxorubicin toxicity.","2012-08-01","2021-09-11 23:37:47","2021-09-11 23:37:47","","290-299","","3","95","","Cardiovasc Res","Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22461523","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AP6WY58S/Gratia et al. - 2012 - Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin at t.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461523","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Enzyme Activation; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Disease Models, Animal; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; DNA Damage; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Energy Metabolism; Heart Diseases; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions.

However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.","2009-09-01","2021-09-11 23:42:25","2021-09-11 23:42:25","","6941-50","","","69","","Cancer research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5NBXCPGY/Mühlenberg et al. - 2009 - Inhibitors of Deacetylases Suppress Oncogenic KIT .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26766848_Inhibitors_of_Deacetylases_Suppress_Oncogenic_KIT_Signaling_Acetylate_HSP90_and_Induce_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dramatic metabolic responses following imatinib treatment indicate a high, KIT-dependent glucose turnover which has been particularly helpful for predicting tumor response to imatinib. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibits glucose metabolism in cancer cells that depend on aerobic glycolysis for ATP production. We show that 2DG inhibits proliferation in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines at levels that can be achieved clinically. KIT-negative GIST48B have 3-14-fold higher IC50 levels than KIT-positive GIST cells indicating that oncogenic KIT may sensitize cells to 2DG. GIST sensitivity to 2DG is increased in low-glucose media (110mg/dl). 2DG leads to dose- and glucose dependent inhibition of KIT glycosylation with resultant reduction of membrane-bound KIT, inhibition of KIT-phosphorylation and inactivation of KIT-dependent signaling intermediates. In contrast to imatinib, 2DG caused ER-stress and elicited the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mannose but not pyruvate rescued GIST cells from 2DG-induced growth arrest, suggesting that loss of KIT integrity is the predominant effect of 2DG in GIST. Additive anti-tumoral effects were seen with imatinib and BH3-mimetics. Our data provide the first evidence that modulation of the glucose-metabolism by 2DG may have a disease-specific effect and may be therapeutically useful in GIST.","2015-03-17","2021-09-11 23:42:51","2021-09-11 23:42:51","","e0120531","","","10","","PloS one","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BYWNTNCH/Mühlenberg et al. - 2015 - Inhibition of KIT-Glycosylation by 2-Deoxyglucose .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273786413_Inhibition_of_KIT-Glycosylation_by_2-Deoxyglucose_Abrogates_KIT-Signaling_and_Combination_with_ABT-263_Synergistically_Induces_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as the second and third line therapies to overcome some of these drug-resistance mutations; however, their limited clinical response, toxicity and resistance of the activation loop mutants still makes new therapies bearing different cKIT mutants activity spectrum profile highly demanded. Through a drug repositioning approach, we found that cabozantinib exhibited higher potency than imatinib against primary gain-of-function mutations of cKIT. Moreover, cabozantinib was able to overcome cKIT gatekeeper T670I mutation and the activation loop mutations that are resistant to imatinib or sunitinib. Cabozantinib demonstrated good efficacy in vitro and in vivo in the cKIT mutant-driven preclinical models of GISTs while displaying a long-lasting effect after treatment withdrawal.

Considering clinical safety and PK profile of cabozantinib, this report provides the basis for the future clinical applications of cabozantinib as an alternative anti-GISTs therapy in precision medicine.","2019-04-10","2021-09-11 23:44:26","2021-09-11 23:44:26","2021-09-11 23:44:26","105-114","","","447","","Cancer Letters","Repurposing cabozantinib to GISTs","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Activation loop mutants; cKIT T670I mutant; Drug resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The histological features and mutation statuses of GIST PDXs were consistent with those of the original patient tumors, and the models showed TKI sensitivity comparable to clinical responses. Imatinib inhibited the KIT pathway in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 but not GIST-RX1, RX2, and RX4. These GIST PDX models will be useful for studying TKI resistance mechanisms and evaluating novel targeted agents in GIST.","2017-09-11","2021-09-11 23:44:44","2021-09-11 23:44:44","","","","","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q2J4NERQ/Na et al. - 2017 - Establishment and characterization of patient-deri.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319657318_Establishment_and_characterization_of_patient-derived_xenograft_models_of_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_resistant_to_standard_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imatinib-resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and little is known about KIT functional roles in imatinib-resistant GIST. Biological consequences of biochemical inhibition of KIT, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), PLCgamma, MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK were determined by immunoblotting for protein activation, and by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in GIST cell lines from imatinib-sensitive GIST (GIST882), imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST430 and GIST48) and KIT-negative GIST (GIST62). KIT activation was 3- to 6-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48 than in GIST882, whereas total KIT expression was comparable in these three GIST lines. In addition to the higher set point for KIT activation, GIST430 and GIST48 had intrinsic imatinib resistance. After treatment with 1 muM imatinib, residual KIT activation was 6- and 2.8-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48, respectively, compared to GIST882. In all GIST lines, cell growth arrest resulted from PI3-K inhibition, and - to a lesser extent - from MEK/MAPK and mTOR inhibition. Inhibition of JAK/STAT or PLCgamma did not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, only PI3-K inhibition resulted in substantial apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant GISTs. We conclude that GIST secondary KIT mutations can be associated with KIT hyperactivation and imatinib resistance. Targeting critical downstream signaling proteins, such as PI3-K, is a promising therapeutic strategy in imatinib-resistant GISTs.","2007-12-01","2021-09-11 23:45:02","2021-09-11 23:45:02","","7560-8","","","26","","Oncogene","KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MEQURLTR/Bauer et al. - 2007 - KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-res.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6290596_KIT_oncogenic_signaling_mechanisms_in_imatinib-resistant_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_PI3-kinaseAKT_is_a_crucial_survival_pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ERK1/2 (ERK) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and is the terminal node of the pathway. BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies are effective in BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and lung cancers; however, responses are short-lived due to emergence of resistance. Reactivation of ERK signaling is central to the mechanisms of acquired resistance. Therefore, ERK inhibition provides an opportunity to overcome resistance and leads to improved efficacy. In addition, KRAS-mutant cancers remain an unmet medical need in which ERK inhibitors may provide treatment options alone or in combination with other agents. Here, we report identification and activity of LY3214996, a potent, selective, ATP-competitive ERK inhibitor. LY3214996 treatment inhibited the pharmacodynamic biomarker, phospho-p90RSK1, in cells and tumors, and correlated with LY3214996 exposures and antitumor activities. In in vitro cell proliferation assays, sensitivity to LY3214996 correlated with ERK pathway aberrations. LY3214996 showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and regression in xenograft models harboring ERK pathway alterations. Importantly, more than 50% target inhibition for up to 8 to 16 hours was sufficient for significant tumor growth inhibition as single agent in BRAF- and KRAS-mutant models. LY3214996 also exhibited synergistic combination benefit with a pan-RAF inhibitor in a KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer xenograft model. Furthermore, LY3214996 demonstrated antitumor activity in BRAF-mutant models with acquired resistance in vitro and in vivo.

Some evidence suggests that sestrins may inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) through inhibition of RagA/B GTPases or activation of AMPK; however, whether sestrins are also involved in mTORC2 regulation and function is unclear. To investigate the functions and mechanisms of Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), we generated Sesn3 liver-specific transgenic and knockout mice. Our data show that Sesn3 liver-specific knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and Sesn3 transgenic mice were protected against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Using AMPK liver-specific knockout mice, we demonstrate that the Sesn3 insulin-sensitizing effect is largely independent of AMPK. Biochemical analysis reveals that Sesn3 interacts with and activates mTORC2 and subsequently stimulates Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings suggest that Sesn3 can activate Akt via mTORC2 to regulate hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.","2015-04-01","2021-09-11 23:53:52","2021-09-11 23:53:57","2021-09-11 23:53:52","1211-1223","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

The signalling pathways downstream of IL11 are contentious and both STAT3 and ERK have been implicated. Here we show that TGFβ1- or IL11- induced ERK activation is consistently associated with fibrogenesis whereas STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is unrelated to fibroblast activation. Surprisingly, recombinant human IL11, which has been used extensively in mouse experiments to infer STAT3 activity downstream of IL11, non-specifically increases pSTAT3 in Il11ra1 null mouse fibroblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 prevents TGFβ1-induced fibrogenesis but this effect was found to reflect fibroblast dysfunction due to severe proteotoxic ER stress. In contrast, inhibition of MEK/ERK prevented fibrosis in the absence of ER stress. TGFβ1-stimulated ERK/mTOR/P70RSK-driven protein translation was IL11-dependent and selectivity for pro-fibrotic protein synthesis was ascribed to an EPRS-related mechanism. In TGFβ1-stimulated fibroblasts, the anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib caused dose-dependent ER stress, reduced pSTAT/pERK and inhibited pro-fibrotic protein translation, similarly to generic STAT3 inhibitors or ER stressors. Pirfenidone, while anti-fibrotic, had no effect on ER stress whereas anti-IL11 inhibited the ERK/mTOR axis while reducing ER stress. These studies discount a specific role for STAT3 in pro-fibrotic signaling, suggest a novel mechanism of action for nintedanib and prioritise further the IL11 pathway as a therapeutic target for fibrosis.","2021-06-10","2021-09-11 23:55:36","2021-09-11 23:55:37","2021-09-11 23:55:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2021.06.10.447846","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2PKUYV5C/Widjaja et al. - 2021 - Molecular dissection of pro-fibrotic signaling ide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, understanding how MYC protein stability is regulated may lead to effective therapies. Here, we used a previously developed, flow cytometry-based assay that screened a library of >800 protein kinase inhibitors and identified compounds that promoted either the stability or degradation of MYC in a KRAS-mutant PDAC cell line. We validated compounds that stabilized or destabilized MYC and then focused on one compound, UNC10112785, that induced the substantial loss of MYC protein in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell cultures. We determined that this compound is a potent CDK9 inhibitor with a previously uncharacterized scaffold, caused MYC loss through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, and suppresses PDAC anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. We discovered that CDK9 enhanced MYC protein stability through a previously unknown, KRAS-independent mechanism involving direct phosphorylation of MYC at Ser62 Our study thus not only identifies a potential therapeutic target for patients with KRAS-mutant PDAC but also presents the application of a screening strategy that can be more broadly adapted to identify regulators of protein stability.","2019-07-16","2021-09-12 00:05:09","2021-09-12 00:05:09","","eaav7259","","590","12","","Sci Signal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31311847 PMCID: PMC6728149","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MTLMAHUQ/Blake et al. - 2019 - Application of a MYC degradation screen identifies.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311847","","Phosphorylation; Humans; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Protein Stability; Proteolysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Small Molecule Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, but its regulation remains poorly defined. Here we show that depletion of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor, resulted in NLRP3- and ASC (apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain)-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 engagement. TLR2 or TLR4 agonist induced PAI-2 expression, which subsequently stabilized the autophagic protein Beclin 1 to promote autophagy, resulting in decreases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, NLRP3 protein level, and pro-IL-1β processing. Likewise, overexpressing Beclin 1 in PAI-2-deficient cells rescued the suppression of NLRP3 activation in response to LPS.

We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition repressed GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII.","2017-12-15","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","20720-20731","","50","292","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GMIUT3C4/Haj et al. - 2017 - Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 is .pdf","","","chromatin; histone modification; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); phosphorylation; pituitary gland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1–dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1–induced formation of K63-Ub chains and ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains.

RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice.

However, pharmacologically activated p53 can induce diverse responses ranging from cell death to growth arrest and DNA repair, which limits the efficient application of p53-reactivating drugs in clinic. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms defining the biological outcome upon p53 activation remains a grand challenge in the p53 field. Here, we report that concurrent pharmacological activation of p53 and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), result in the synthetic lethality in cancer cells. ROS promote the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and DNA damage response, which establishes a positive feedback loop with p53. This converts the p53-induced growth arrest/senescence to apoptosis. We identified several survival oncogenes inhibited by p53 in JNK-dependent manner, including Mcl1, PI3K, eIF4E, as well as p53 inhibitors Wip1 and MdmX. Further, we show that Wip1 is one of the crucial executors downstream of JNK whose ablation confers the enhanced and sustained p53 transcriptional response contributing to cell death. Our study provides novel insights for manipulating p53 response in a controlled way. Further, our results may enable new pharmacological strategy to exploit abnormally high ROS level, often linked with higher aggressiveness in cancer, to selectively kill cancer cells upon pharmacological reactivation of p53.","2014-04","2021-09-14 05:26:06","2021-09-14 05:26:09","2021-09-14 05:26:06","612-623","","4","21","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2014 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Cancer therapy;Pharmacology Subject_term_id: apoptosis;cancer-therapy;pharmacology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSRSI3RX/Shi et al. - 2014 - ROS-dependent activation of JNK converts p53 into .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, MYC, a potent oncogene, is an antinecroptotic factor that directly suppresses the formation of the RIPK1–RIPK3 complex. Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that the MYC pathway is the most prominently down-regulated signaling pathway during necroptosis. Depletion or deletion of MYC promotes the RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction, thereby stabilizing the RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and facilitating necroptosis. Interestingly, MYC binds to RIPK3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in vitro. Furthermore, MYC-nick, a truncated form that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, prevented TNF-induced necroptosis. Finally, down-regulation of MYC enhances necroptosis in leukemia cells and suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model upon treatment with birinapant and emricasan. MYC-mediated suppression of necroptosis is a mechanism of necroptosis resistance in cancer, and approaches targeting MYC to induce necroptosis represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer.","2020-08-18","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","19982-19993","","33","117","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/43BUNHPP/Seong et al. - 2020 - Identification of MYC as an antinecroptotic protei.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation is still unclear. Here we report that the expression of cytokines is robustly upregulated in a cell-autonomous manner during necroptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). We demonstrate that TNFα-induced necroptosis leads to two waves of cytokine production. The first wave, more transient and weaker than the second, is in response to TNFα alone; whereas the second wave depends upon the necroptotic signaling. We show that necroptosis promotes the transcription of TNFα-target genes in a cell-intrinsic manner. The activation of both NF-κB and p38 by the necroptotic machinery, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, is involved in mediating the robust induction of cytokine expression in the second wave. In contrast, necroptosis induced by direct oligomerization of MLKL promotes cytokine production at much lower levels than that of necroptosis induced with TNFα. Thus, we conclude that TNFα-induced necroptosis signaling events mediated by RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation, in addition to the MLKL oligomerization, promotes the expression of cytokines involving multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms including NF-κB pathway and p38. These findings reveal that the necroptotic cell death machinery mounts an immune response by promoting cell-autonomous production of cytokines. Our study provides insights into the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation in human diseases.","2018-04-27","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","1-16","","5","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2YPPXFNL/Zhu et al. - 2018 - Necroptosis promotes cell-autonomous activation of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Macrophages are key innate immune cells that upon encountering pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing cytokines, including IFN-β. In this study, we identify a novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing IFN-β production in macrophages. Using genetic and pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1 directs IFN-β synthesis induced by LPS in mice. Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase–dependent IFN-β production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in bone marrow–derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases. Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1 and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF–dependent IFN-β production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4. Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase–dependent synthesis of IFN-β is markedly induced by avirulent strains of Gram-negative bacteria, Yersinia and Klebsiella, and less so by their wild-type counterparts. Overall, these observations identify unexpected roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases in the production of IFN-β during the host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and suggest that the axis in which these kinases operate may represent a target for bacterial virulence factors.","2017-06-01","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","4435-4447","","11","198","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","","","","www.jimmunol.org","","Publisher: American Association of Immunologists Section: INNATE IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION PMID: 28461567","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FJB9MMXU/Saleh et al. - 2017 - Kinase Activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 Can Direct IF.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Results: MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity.

In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206–sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. Conclusions: MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

Despite this wealth of information the precise signalling timeline and effectors engaged by Ras, particularly during G1, remain obscure as approaches for Ras inhibition are slow-acting and ill-suited for charting discrete Ras signalling episodes along the cell cycle. We have developed an approach based on the inducible recruitment of a Ras-GAP that enforces endogenous Ras inhibition within minutes. Applying this strategy to inhibit Ras stepwise in synchronous cell populations revealed that Ras signaling was required well into G1 for Cyclin D induction, pocket protein phosphorylation and S-phase entry, irrespective of whether cells emerged from quiescence or G2/M. Unexpectedly, Erk, and not PI3K/Akt or Ral was activated by Ras at mid-G1, albeit PI3K/Akt signalling was a necessary companion of Ras/Erk for sustaining cyclin-D levels and G1/S transition. Our findings chart mitogenic signaling by endogenous Ras during G1 and identify limited effector engagement restricted to Raf/MEK/Erk as a cogent distinction from oncogenic Ras signalling.","2019-01-17","2021-09-14 05:58:02","2021-09-14 05:58:03","2021-09-14 05:58:02","204-225","","2","18","","Cell Cycle","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7VUAPSGY/Vasjari et al. - 2019 - Ras signals principally via Erk in G1 but cooperat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for the treatment of certain cancers, major success in targeting mTOR, particularly with new generation mTOR kinase inhibitors, for the effective treatment of cancers has not been achieved. Hence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the mTOR axis in cancer is still needed. It is now recognized that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on cancer cells is a critical mechanism contributing to immunosuppression and immune escape via interacting with program death-1 (PD-1) on immune cells. This study has revealed a previously undiscovered role of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the negative regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that disruption of this signaling pathway with mTOR inhibitors, raptor knockdown or p70S6K inhibitors elevated PD-L1 levels in some lung and other cancer cell lines. Elevation of PD-L1 by inhibition of mTORC1/p70S6K signaling is likely due to suppression of β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation of PD-L1, because inhibition of either mTORC1 or p70S6K facilitated β-TrCP degradation accompanied with enhanced PD-L1 protein stabilization. Our current findings indicate the complexity of the mTOR axis in cancer, which should be considered when targeting this axis for effective cancer treatment. Our findings also suggest a strong scientific rationale for enhancing PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy through co-targeting mTORC1/p70S6K signaling.","2019-08","2021-09-14 06:07:28","2021-09-14 06:07:31","2021-09-14 06:07:30","6270-6282","","35","38","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 35 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour immunology Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-immunology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/K7SGNPBL/Deng et al. - 2019 - Inhibition of mTOR complex 1p70 S6 kinase signali.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R3ZA8SHW/s41388-019-0877-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6V8TR9W8/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition.

Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.","2013-07-30","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","12661-12666","","31","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 23842089","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XE8FZ5F6/Völkers et al. - 2013 - Pathological hypertrophy amelioration by PRAS40-me.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P2E7ZRTE/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.","2016-08","2021-09-14 06:21:58","2021-09-14 06:22:03","2021-09-14 06:21:58","4518-4528","","34","35","","","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 34 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Bladder cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;bladder-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X36V87I3/King et al. - 2016 - Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies syn.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/T8X5PHIU/onc2015511.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify the mechanism by which Src overexpression sustains this resistance, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines either sensitive or resistant to lapatinib. Methods: To determine the role of Src in lapatinib resistance, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition/silencing in vitro on survival, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. In vivo experiments were performed in JIMT-1 lapatinib-resistant cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice. We used artificial metastasis assays to evaluate the effect of Src inhibition on the invasiveness of lapatinib-resistant cells. Src-dependent signal transduction was investigated with Western blot and ELISA analyses. Results: Src activation was higher in lapatinib-resistant than in lapatinib-sensitive cells. The selective small-molecule Src inhibitor saracatinib combined with lapatinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. Saracatinib combined with lapatinib significantly prolonged survival of JIMT-1-xenografted mice compared with saracatinib alone, and impaired the formation of lung metastases. Unexpectedly, in lapatinib-resistant cells, Src preferentially interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rather than with HER2. Moreover, EGFR targeting and lapatinib synergistically inhibited survival, migration, and invasion of resistant cells, thereby counteracting Src-mediated resistance. These findings demonstrate that Src activation in lapatinib-resistant cells depends on EGFRdependent rather than on HER2-dependent signaling. Conclusions: Complete pharmacologic EGFR/HER2 inhibition is required to reverse Src-dependent resistance to lapatinib in breast cancer.","2014-06","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","R45","","3","16","","Breast Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D7D5JJ2J/Formisano et al. - 2014 - Epidermal growth factor-receptor activation modula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rapamycin inhibited S6 phosphorylation and cell proliferation, and resulted in lower levels of apoptosis induction. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and S6, synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis with a higher efficacy.

However, the role of MLN4924 in induction of autophagy and its biological significance are totally unknown. Here we showed that MLN4924 effectively induces autophagy in both time- and dose-dependent manners in multiple human cancer lines, indicating a general phenomenon. Mechanistically, by inactivating CRLs, MLN4924 causes accumulation of DEPTOR and HIF1α. The siRNA knockdown and gene KO studies showed that DEPTOR and the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis are responsible for MLN4924-induced autophagy via inhibiting mTORC1. Biologically, autophagy is a survival signal to tumor cells, and blockage of autophagy via siRNA knockdown, gene KO and small molecule inhibitor remarkably enhanced MLN4924-induced apoptosis.

There is no effective therapy for patients with metastatic UM. Improved treatments of hepatic metastatic patients with UM were urgently needed. Inspired by readily detectable key components in the neddylation pathway in UM cells, we aimed at exploring whether neddylation pathway was a therapeutic target for liver metastatic UM. Experimental Design: Expression of key proteins in the neddylation pathway in UM was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemical staining. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) properties were examined upon treatment with MLN4924, a potent and selective NAE inhibitor. Antitumor activity and frequency of CSCs were determined by using a NOD-SCID mouse xenograft model. Liver metastasis was evaluated by use of a NOD-scid-IL2Rg−/− mouse model. Results: NAE1 expression was readily detectable in UM. Inhibition of the neddylation pathway by MLN4924 repressed the CSCs properties in UM (capacities of tumorsphere formation and serially replating, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive cells, and frequency of CSC) through Slug protein degradation. MLN4924 treatment disturbed the paracrine secretion of NF-κB-mediated VEGF-C and its dependent angiogenesis. The inhibitory effect of neddylation blockade on proliferation, which was confirmed by xenografted UM tumor in NOD-SCID mice, was involved in activation of ATM-Chk1-Cdc25C DNA damage response, and G2–M phase arrest. Neddylation inhibition profoundly inhibited hepatic metastasis in UM.

Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with various types of cancer including glioma. Here, we show that high level expression of NDRG1 in tumors significantly correlated with better prognosis of patients with GBM. Loss of NDRG1 in GBM cells upregulated GSK3β levels and promoted cell proliferation, which was reversed by selective inhibitors of GSK3β. In contrast, NDRG1 overexpression suppressed growth of GBM cells by decreasing GSK3β levels via proteasomal degradation and by suppressing AKT and S6 cell growth signaling, as well as cell-cycle signaling pathways. Conversely, GSK3β phosphorylated serine and threonine sites in the C-terminal domain of NDRG1 and limited the protein stability of NDRG1. Furthermore, treatment with differentiation inducing factor-1, a small molecule derived from Dictyostelium discoideum, enhanced NDRG1 expression, decreased GSK3β expression, and exerted marked NDRG1-dependent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which NDRG1 inhibits GBM proliferation and progression. Our study thus identifies the NDRG1/GSK3β signaling pathway as a key growth regulatory program in GBM, and suggests enhancing NDRG1 expression in GBM as a potent strategy toward the development of anti-GBM therapeutics.

However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1−XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1−XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-κB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.","2018-07-24","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","1-16","","8","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LB5TWTM/Jeong et al. - 2018 - XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IV83MPKV/s41419-018-0867-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MLN4924 therefore inhibits also the βTrCP-dependent activation of the classical and the alternative NFĸB pathway. In this work, we found that a subgroup of multiple myeloma cell lines (e.g., RPMI-8226, MM.1S, KMS-12BM) and about half of the primary myeloma samples tested are sensitized to TNF-induced cell death by MLN4924. This correlated with MLN4924-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced activation of the classical NFκB pathway and reduced the efficacy of TNF-induced TNFR1 signaling complex formation. Interestingly, binding studies revealed a straightforward correlation between cell surface TNFR1 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines and their sensitivity for MLN4924/TNF-induced cell death. The cell surface expression levels of TNFR1 in the investigated MM cell lines largely correlated with TNFR1 mRNA expression. This suggests that the variable levels of cell surface expression of TNFR1 in myeloma cell lines are decisive for TNF/MLN4924 sensitivity. Indeed, introduction of TNFR1 into TNFR1-negative TNF/MLN4924-resistant KMS-11BM cells, was sufficient to sensitize this cell line for TNF/MLN4924-induced cell death. Thus, MLN4924 might be especially effective in myeloma patients with TNFR1+ myeloma cells and a TNFhigh tumor microenvironment.","2019-08-13","2021-09-14 06:42:55","2021-09-14 06:42:59","2021-09-14 06:42:55","1-15","","8","10","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour-necrosis factors Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-necrosis-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KJNMMU3R/El-Mesery et al. - 2019 - The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 sens.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular mechanisms involved in the responses to RITA remain enigmatic. Several groups reported the induction of a p53-dependent DNA damage response. Furthermore, the existence of a p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint has been suggested, involving the checkpoint kinase Chk1. We have recently shown synergistic induction of apoptosis by RITA in combination with Nutlin-3, and we observed concomitant Chk2 phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated whether Chk2 contributes to the cellular responses to RITA. Strikingly, the induction of apoptosis seemed entirely Chk2 dependent. Transcriptional activity of p53 in response to RITA required the presence of Chk2. A partial rescue of apoptosis observed in Noxa knockdown cells emphasized the relevance of p53 transcriptional activity for RITA-induced apoptosis. In addition, we observed an early p53- and Chk2-dependent block of DNA replication upon RITA treatment. Replicating cells seemed more prone to entering RITA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the RITA-induced DNA damage response, which was not a secondary effect of apoptosis induction, was strongly attenuated in cells lacking p53 or Chk2. In conclusion, we identified Chk2 as an essential mediator of the cellular responses to RITA.","2012-06","2021-09-14 06:46:06","2021-09-14 06:46:08","2021-09-14 06:46:06","980-989","","6","19","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IM5NVWNK/de Lange et al. - 2012 - Chk2 mediates RITA-induced apoptosis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas arginine activates mTORC1, it is overridden by high expression of cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1). Because cancer cells often encounter low levels of nutrients, an alternative mechanism might exist to regulate CASTOR1 expression. Here we show K29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of CASTOR1 by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF167. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylates CASTOR1 at S14, significantly increasing its binding to RNF167, and hence its ubiquitination and degradation, while simultaneously decreasing its affinity to MIOS, leading to mTORC1 activation. Therefore, AKT activates mTORC1 through both TSC2- and CASTOR1-dependent pathways. Several cell types with high CASTOR1 expression are insensitive to arginine regulation. Significantly, AKT and RNF167-mediated CASTOR1 degradation activates mTORC1 independent of arginine and promotes breast cancer progression. These results illustrate a mTORC1 regulating mechanism and identify RNF167 as a therapeutic target for mTORC1-dysregulated diseases.","2021-02-16","2021-09-14 06:48:33","2021-09-14 06:48:36","2021-09-14 06:48:33","1055","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer metabolism Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-metabolism","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TVJZP948/Li et al. - 2021 - RNF167 activates mTORC1 and promotes tumorigenesis.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7W47DN2V/s41467-021-21206-3.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 α-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNFα-induced neurotoxicity. Opposite to the Alzheimer Disease transgenic mice, the PDK1 knock-in mice exhibited an age-dependent attenuation of the unfolding protein response, which protected the mutant neurons against endoplasmic reticulum stressors.

A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone.

Consequently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the EGFR are among the most effective therapies for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Clinical responses to the EGFR-targeting TKIs are evaluated through 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>FDG)-PET uptake, which is decreased in patients responding favorably to therapy and is positively correlated with survival. Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for glycolysis stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib's anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling. These results support the potential clinical utility of using PFKFB3 inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs to manage NSCLC.</p>","2019-07-05","2021-09-14 07:36:13","2021-09-14 07:36:15","2021-09-14 07:36:13","10530-10543","","27","294","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 31126985","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/24BZKJ3G/Lypova et al. - 2019 - Increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-2,6-bi.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I7HJG8EK/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether AMPK activation itself is sufficient to block cancer cell growth remains to be determined. A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone. This study thus provides a rationale for their combined use in CRPC treatment.","2014-04-01","2021-09-14 07:46:07","2021-09-14 07:46:07","2021-09-14 07:46:07","519-538","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-embopress-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YXRDL8EG/2014 - A novel direct activator of AMPK inhibits prostate.pdf","","","prostate cancer; AMPK direct activation; androgen signaling inhibitors; de novo lipogenesis; MT 63–78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have reported previously that TGF-β1 induces the selective up-regulation of mitochondrial Nox4, playing critical roles in podocyte apoptosis. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Nox4 up-regulation by mTORC1 activation on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in immortalized podocytes. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Blocking TGF-β receptor I with SB431542 completely blunted the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. Transient adenoviral overexpression of mTOR-WT and constitutively active mTORΔ augmented TGF-β1-treated Nox4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis, whereas mTOR kinase-dead suppressed the above changes. In addition, knockdown of mTOR mimicked the effect of mTOR-KD. Inhibition of mTORC1 by low-dose rapamycin or knockdown of p70S6K protected podocytes through attenuation of Nox4 expression and subsequent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by TGF-β1. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade, but not the PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway, abolished TGF-β1-induced mTOR activation. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 or mTORC1 did not reduce the TGF-β1-stimulated increase in Nox4 mRNA level but significantly inhibited total Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, double knockdown of Smad2 and 3 or only Smad4 completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2-mTORactivation. Our data suggest that TGF-β1 increases translation of Nox4 through the Smad-ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis, which is independent of transcriptional regulation. Activation of this pathway plays a crucial role in ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to podocyte apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic and preventive target in proteinuric and chronic kidney diseases.</p>","2015-12-25","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","30830-30842","","52","290","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IL954EFQ/Das et al. - 2015 - Transforming Growth Factor β1-induced Apoptosis in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identification of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP) substrates is therefore critical to understand SCFβ-TRCP biology and function. Here, we used a β-TRCP-phosphodegron-motif specific antibody in a β-TRCP substrate screen coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple β-TRCP substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the family of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that SCFβ-TRCP specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-TRCP depletion in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-TRCP1 knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of β-TRCP in regulating hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through modulating Lipin1 stability.","2017-01-03","2021-09-14 07:59:21","2021-09-14 07:59:21","2021-09-14 07:59:21","eaah4117","","460","10","","Sci Signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28049764 PMCID: PMC5215841","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/45Y3WRJ9/Shimizu et al. - 2017 - The SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets .pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215841/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NF2/Merlin tumour suppressor functions both at the cell cortex and nucleus and is a key mediator of contact inhibition but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we have used affinity proteomics to identify novel Merlin interacting proteins and show that Merlin forms a complex with multiple proteins involved in RNA processing including the PAFC and the CHD1 chromatin remodeller. Tumour-derived inactivating mutations in both Merlin and the CDC73 PAFC subunit mutually disrupt their interaction and growth suppression by Merlin requires CDC73. Merlin interacts with the PAFC in a cell density-dependent manner and we identify a role for FAT cadherins in regulating the Merlin-PAFC interaction. Our results suggest that in addition to its function within the Hippo pathway, Merlin is part of a tumour suppressor network regulated by cell-cell adhesion which coordinates post-initiation steps of the transcription cycle of genes mediating contact inhibition.","2021-08-23","2021-09-16 03:49:49","2021-09-16 03:49:56","2021-09-16 03:49:50","e0254697","","8","16","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Y5JCSMQG/Roehrig et al. - 2021 - Cell-cell adhesion regulates MerlinNF2 interactio.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4UVHSY93/article.html","","","Immunoprecipitation; Transfection; Cancers and neoplasms; Chromatin; Fats; Gene expression; Gene regulation; Transcriptional control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
