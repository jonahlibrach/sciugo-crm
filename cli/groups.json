          "overview": "Acris GmbH was founded 1998 as a spinoff of DPC Biermann GmbH, the German subsidiary of Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles. Acris took over responsibility for marketing the DPC Biermann research products, mostly antibodies.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning it was our mission to serve the research community with high quality research products. It was our strategy to develop a platform for thousands of high quality antibodies in one easy to search online database. Now 15 years after founding the company we offer more than 210,000 primary antibodies partly sold as Acris branded products partly offered as distributed products from all over the world. As complementary products we added more than 40,000 proteins, 15,000 lysates and 4,000 kits.\r\nDuring the years Acris Antibodies developed from a German distributor to a global player in the research product / antibody market. Distributors in Europe and Asia were added and in the beginning of 2011 we set up our US subsidiary Acris Antibodies Inc. in San Diego. \r\n\r\nThe next step will be to evolve into a real antibody manufacturing company during 2013 and 2014. The basis will be our new lab in San Diego able to manufacture catalog and custom antibodies and peptides. In addition antibody testing services will be offered for flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and western blotting. The lab will also be able to manufacture monoclonal antibodies."

We develop our product candidates to address emerging biological targets using our proprietary antibody discovery technology platform, which is based upon a breakthrough understanding of the natural process of antibody generation, known as somatic hypermutation, or SHM, and replicates this natural process of antibody generation in vitro. Our strategy is to advance the development and commercialization of our proprietary product candidates, and for certain programs, establish partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies where we retain certain development and commercialization rights in the United States.\n\nOur wholly-owned product pipeline includes etokimab (ANB020) and ANB019, which are being developed to treat severe inflammatory disorders with unmet medical need. We are advancing etokimab, an antibody that inhibits the activity of interleukin-33, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult eosinophilic asthma, and adult chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\n\nIn addition, we are developing our ANB019 product candidate, an antibody that inhibits the interleukin-36 receptor, for the treatment of rare inflammatory diseases called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP).\n\nOur company is led by a strong management team with a proven track record of successfully growing biotechnology companies with deep experience in antibody discovery and development, collaborations, operations and corporate finance.\n\nAdditionally, multiple AnaptysBio-generated antibodies have entered the clinic under our immuno-oncology-focused collaboration with TESARO and inflammation-focused collaboration with Celgene.\n\nFor more information, visit www.anaptysbio.com."

          "overview": "At Kerafast, our mission is to make unique laboratory-made research tools easily accessible to the global scientific community. Our portfolio includes cell lines, antibodies, small molecules, dyes and more, many of which are not available elsewhere. Since our founding in 2011, researchers from more than 170 institutions worldwide have made their innovative reagents available through our online platform, where the materials can be quickly accessed without needing to go through the traditional Material Transfer Agreement process.\n\nWe handle all selling and shipping logistics for the providing laboratory, as well as return generous royalty payments from every sale. We therefore help providing labs save time and resources, while generating extra funding for further research. Procuring scientists can more easily discover and access unique reagents that are often unavailable elsewhere, while also funding the work of other researchers. This creates a global community of scientists contributing and accessing Reagents for the Greater Good to accelerate their own research as well as scientific progress overall.\n\nIn 2018, Kerafast merged with Absolute Antibody, a UK-based company with a vision to make recombinant antibody technology available to all researchers. The merger brought together two companies with a shared commitment to improving the selection of research tools available to the scientific community."

These communications may appear legitimate due to an official-looking Acadia email address or website, referencing of an actual recruiter and/or manager at Acadia (easily found on LinkedIn), and/or offer documents falsely signed by an Acadia executive. The impostor uses the incentive of a job interview and job offer to solicit sensitive personal information from the intended victim.\n\nPlease note that the Acadia Talent Acquisition and HR Team will ONLY interact with a candidate from \"Acadia-pharm.com\" domain sourced emails. We do not request sensitive personal information, such as a Social Security Number, or payments of any kind during the interview or job offer process.

Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, our therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Our RNAi-based therapeutics are at the leading edge of genetic-based therapy with the potential to bring life changing treatments for patients.\n\nOur Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform utilizes ligand-mediated delivery and is designed to enable tissue-specific targeting while being structurally simple. The TRiM platform builds on more than a decade of work on actively targeted drug delivery and offers several advantages including simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration; and potential for improved safety.   \n\nOur employees are nimble, science-driven, and innovative professionals.   A career at Arrowhead offers the opportunity to collaborate with top notch scientists to rapidly discover and develop RNAi-based therapeutics to add to our growing pipeline.     \n\nResearch and development activities are located in Madison, WI. Our R&D group includes fully-integrated capabilities for chemistry, biology, and toxicology. Madison is an exciting and sophisticated city that includes state government, the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin, and major research organizations.\n\nOur HQ, clinical and regulatory operations are located in Pasadena, CA.

          "overview": "At Mirimus, our mission is to change the paradigm of the current drug discovery process by developing superior preclinical RNA interference (RNAi) animal models that can predict toxicities of potential drug therapies without the actual drug itself. The cost of developing drugs has continued to skyrocket, mostly attributable to the number of drug compounds that fail in late-stage clinical trials either due to lack of efficacy or unpredicted toxicities that impede their use in humans. Thus, the need for more innovative approaches to perform proof-of-mechanism, efficacy and safety studies early on within the discovery pipeline has never been greater. Mirimus\u2019 advanced RNAi technology platform enables potent reversible gene silencing in vivo, and has been shown to effectively mimic drug therapy, enabling pharmaceutical companies the ability to evaluate specific gene targets or combination targets prior to expensive drug development. \r\n\r\nWe also aim to remain at the cutting edge of biomedical research, incorporating the latest emerging technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and engineering the most advanced research tools for high impact screening assays and sophisticated disease model creation. With our rapid and cost-effective approaches, we have pioneered the way for systematic production of large cohorts of preclinical subjects, designed to more precisely model human disease and ready to evaluate therapeutic potential of specific gene targets. By synergizing CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi technologies, our next generation CRISPR/Cas9-RNAi mouse models will serve to transform preclinical drug discovery research and drive the development of effective and safe candidate therapies to combat human disease."
