We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. While TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an <i>Mtor S2159A</i> knock-in allele (<i>Mtor</i><sup>A/A</sup>) using <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promote mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 co-immunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal crosstalk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings.</p>","2021-07-07","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","","","0","0","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 34245780","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XLIJMBCF/Tooley et al. - 2021 - The innate immune kinase TBK1 directly increases m.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4DC8B9HT/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245780","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RIG-I and MDA5 are essential pathogen recognition receptors sensing viral infections while LGP2 has been described as both RLR cofactor and negative regulator. After sensing and binding to viral RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RIG-I and MDA5 undergo cytosol-to-membrane relocalization to bind and signal through the MAVS adaptor protein on intracellular membranes, thus directing downstream activation of IRF3 and innate immunity. Here, we report examination of the dynamic subcellular localization of all three RLRs within the intracellular response to dsRNA and RNA virus infection. Observations from high resolution biochemical fractionation and electron microscopy, coupled with analysis of protein interactions and IRF3 activation, show that, in resting cells, microsome but not mitochondrial fractions harbor the central components to initiate innate immune signaling. LGP2 interacts with MAVS in microsomes, blocking the RIG-I/MAVS interaction. Remarkably, in response to dsRNA treatment or RNA virus infection, LGP2 is rapidly released from MAVS and redistributed to mitochondria, temporally correlating with IRF3 activation. We reveal that IRF3 activation does not take place on mitochondria but instead occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes. Our observations suggest ER-derived membranes as key RLR signaling platforms controlled through inhibitory actions of LGP2 binding to MAVS wherein LGP2 translocation to mitochondria releases MAVS inhibition to facilitate RLR-mediated signaling of innate immunity.</p>","2020-07-07","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","15778-15788","","27","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32571931","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IQQZSGTR/Esser-Nobis et al. - 2020 - Spatiotemporal dynamics of innate immune signaling.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heterodimerization of RAF kinases as well as dephosphorylation of a conserved “S259” inhibitory site are important steps for RAF activation but the precise mechanisms and dynamics remain unclear. A ternary complex comprised of SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 (SHOC2 complex) functions as a RAF S259 holophosphatase and gain-of-function mutations in SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 that promote complex formation are found in Noonan syndrome. Here we show that SHOC2 complex-mediated S259 RAF dephosphorylation is critically required for growth factor-induced RAF heterodimerization as well as for MEK dissociation from BRAF. We also uncover SHOC2-independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK pathway activation that rely on N-region phosphorylation of CRAF. In DLD-1 cells stimulated with EGF, SHOC2 function is essential for a rapid transient phase of ERK activation, but is not required for a slow, sustained phase that is instead driven by palmitoylated H/N-RAS proteins and CRAF. Whereas redundant SHOC2-dependent and -independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK activation make SHOC2 dispensable for proliferation in 2D, KRAS mutant cells preferentially rely on SHOC2 for ERK signaling under anchorage-independent conditions. Our study highlights a context-dependent contribution of SHOC2 to ERK pathway dynamics that is preferentially engaged by KRAS oncogenic signaling and provides a biochemical framework for selective ERK pathway inhibition by targeting the SHOC2 holophosphatase.</p>","2019-07-02","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","13330-13339","","27","116","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs. ATR inhibitor VE822 combined with PARPi extended survival of mice bearing GSC-derived orthotopic tumors, irrespective of PARPi-sensitivity. These studies identify a role of CDK18 in ATR-regulated HR.

Unlike the well-characterized antiapoptotic chaperone Hsp70, Hsp90 is not a general inhibitor of apoptosis, but it assumes this role in systems such as small-cell lung carcinoma, in which apoptosis is uniquely dependent on and effected through the intrinsic pathway, without involvement of caspase elements upstream of mitochondria or alternate pathways that are not apoptosome-channeled.

Here, we show that Akt activation is a convergent feature of acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, across a spectrum of diverse, established upstream resistance mechanisms. Combined treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and Akt inhibitor causes apoptosis and synergistic growth inhibition in multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer models. Moreover, phospho-Akt levels are increased in most clinical specimens obtained from EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer patients with acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance.

Furthermore, triple combination with AKTi significantly inhibits growth of patient-derived xenografts resistant to combined CDK4/6i and fulvestrant. Finally, high phospho-AKT levels in metastasis of breast cancer patients treated with a combination of CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy correlates with shorter progression-free survival. Our findings support the clinical development of ER, CDK4/6 and AKT co-targeting strategies following progression on CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy combination, and in tumors exhibiting high phospho-AKT levels, which are associated with worse clinical outcome.","2021-08-25","2021-08-28 19:29:54","2021-08-28 19:29:54","2021-08-28 19:29:54","5112","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Translational research Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;translational-research","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RIBG3LZK/Alves et al. - 2021 - Co-targeting CDK46 and AKT with endocrine therapy.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6KL2HTNT/s41467-021-25422-9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a panel pre-clinical models to reveal that PI3K isoform dependency is not governed by loss of PTEN and is impacted by feedback inhibition and concurrent PIK3CA/PIK3CB alterations. Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

Somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have emerged as promising agents for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS-mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. Here, we demonstrate that the selective pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. Our analysis using RNAi and TAK-632 in preclinical models reveals that the MAPK pathway of NRAS-mutated melanoma cells is highly dependent on RAF. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. As a result, TAK-632 demonstrates potent antiproliferative effects both on NRAS-mutated melanoma cells and BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through NRAS mutation or BRAF truncation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor TAK-733 exhibits synergistic antiproliferative effects on these cells. Our findings characterize the unique features of TAK-632 as a pan-RAF inhibitor and provide rationale for its further investigation in NRAS-mutated melanoma and a subset of BRAF-mutated melanomas refractory to BRAF inhibitors.

The development of acquired resistance is inevitable due to the signaling pathway rewiring. Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of these cells. Our study reveals that mTOR activation is essential for drug resistance of melanoma to MAPK inhibitors, and provides insight into the rewiring of the signaling networks in CR melanoma.","2021-07-24","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Melanoma Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;melanoma","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EIVUJNAA/Wang et al. - 2021 - Targeting mTOR signaling overcomes acquired resist.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JBTR26XA/s41388-021-01911-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significantly, nilotinib (2nd generation ABL1/2 inhibitor) reverses resistance, in vivo, causing prolonged regression of resistant tumors, and also, prevents BRAFi/MEKi resistance from developing in the first place.

Robust ERK1/2 activation following MEKi withdrawal drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, selecting against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and reversal of MEKi resistance. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, validating intermittent dosing to forestall resistance. In contrast, resistance driven by KRASG13D amplification is not reversible; rather ERK1/2 hyperactivation drives ZEB1-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance, arguing strongly against the use of drug holidays in cases of KRASG13D amplification.","2019-05-02","2021-08-30 08:36:30","2021-09-07 20:09:35","2021-08-30 08:36:30","2030","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2019 Crown","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Growth factor signalling;Kinases Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;growth-signalling;kinases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/98E78G4S/Sale et al. - 2019 - MEK12 inhibitor withdrawal reverses acquired resi.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VPX7GNWP/s41467-019-09438-w.html","","_company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HSF1 is also involved in chemoresistance, and several studies have demonstrated the relationship between HSF1 and MDR1 but without any consistent results. Paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells showed higher expression of MDR1 and HSF1. Depletion of HSF1 decreased mdr1 expression at mRNA level, and HSF1 directly interacted with the promoter site of mdr1, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator of MDR1. Phosphorylation of Ser303/307, which was involved in protein stability of HSF1 by FBXW7-mediated degradation, was found to be important for transcriptional activation of mdr1. Drug-resistant cells showed decreased expression of FBXW7, which was mediated by the activation of ERK1/2, thus indicating that over-activation of ERK1/2 in drug-resistant cells decreased FBXW7 protein stability, which finally inhibited protein degradation of pHSF1 at Ser303/307. There was a positive correlation between immunofluorescence data of pHSF1 at Ser303/307 and MDR1 in carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors and human lung cancers.

The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of Mdm2, which impedes Mdm2 autoubiquitination and degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization of Mdm2. MARCH7 also promotes Mdm2-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, MARCH7 is able to regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and tumorigenesis via a p53-dependent mechanism. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of Mdm2 and reveal MARCH7 as an important regulator of the Mdm2?p53 pathway.","2018-02-01","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","305-319","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IB4MFKRK/2018 - Regulation of the Mdm2–p53 pathway by the ubiquiti.pdf","","","MARCH7; Mdm2; p53; ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy activation and the development of hypoxic regions within the tumors are known to promote cancer cell resistance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy and hypoxia on the taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol induced apoptosis after 16 h of incubation, and that hypoxia protected MDA-MB-231 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. In parallel, taxol induced autophagy activation already after 2 h of incubation both under normoxia and hypoxia. Autophagy activation after taxol exposure was shown to be a protective mechanism against taxol-induced cell death both under normoxia and hypoxia. However, at longer incubation time, the autophagic process reached a saturation point under normoxia leading to cell death, whereas under hypoxia, autophagy flow still correctly took place allowing the cells to survive. Autophagy induction is induced after taxol exposure via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, which is more important in cells exposed to hypoxia. Taxol also induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and phosphorylation of its substrates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and BCL2-like 1 (BclXL) under normoxia and hypoxia very early after taxol exposure. Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation was decreased more importantly under hypoxia after long incubation time. The role of JNK in autophagy and apoptosis induction was studied using siRNAs. The results showed that JNK activation promotes resistance against taxol-induced apoptosis under normoxia and hypoxia without being involved in induction of autophagy. In conclusion, the resistance against taxol-induced cell death observed under hypoxia can be explained by a more effective autophagic flow activated via the classical mTOR pathway and by a mechanism involving JNK, which could be dependent on Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation but independent of JNK-induced autophagy activation.","2013-05","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","e638-e638","","5","4","","Cell Death Dis","Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells","","","","","","","en","2013 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Breast cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;breast-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/554QSFB4/Notte et al. - 2013 - Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDUUEBQY/cddis2013167.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction &gt;90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.</p>","2015-07-21","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YNHPDB6Z/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VMFKBSNI/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EGFR mutations identify lung cancer patients who can derive benefit from TKIs, but most patients develop resistance to the first-, second-, and third-generation drugs. To explore alternatives to such whack-a-mole strategies, we simulated in patient-derived xenograft models the situation of patients receiving first-line TKIs. Monotherapies comprising approved first-line TKIs were compared to combinations with antibodies specific to EGFR and HER2. We observed uniform and strong superiority of all drug combinations over the respective monotherapies. Prolonged treatments, high TKI dose, and specificity were essential for drug?drug cooperation. Blocking pathways essential for mitosis (e.g., FOXM1), along with downregulation of resistance-conferring receptors (e.g., AXL), might underlie drug cooperation. Thus, upfront treatments using combinations of TKIs and antibodies can prevent emergence of resistance and hence might replace the widely applied sequential treatments utilizing next-generation TKIs.","2021-04-09","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","e13144","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CYLCPIC2/2021 - Upfront admixing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors pr.pdf","","","EGFR TKIs; first-line therapy; mAbs; NSCLC; resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET.

Since the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are frequently upregulated in HCC, we have analyzed the effects of AKT inhibitor MK-2206, MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) and mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055, given as single drugs or in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis of three HCC cell lines in vitro. We show that all three inhibitor combinations synergistically inhibit proliferation of the three HCC cell lines, with the strongest synergistic effect observed after vertical inhibition of AKT and mTORC1/2. We demonstrate that AKT kinase activity is restored 24h after blockade of mTORC1/2 by increased phosphorylation of T308, providing a rationale for combined targeting of AKT and mTOR inhibition in HCC. Our data suggest that a combination of inhibitors targeting those respective pathways may be a viable approach for future application in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","2015","2021-08-30 16:59:49","2021-08-30 16:59:49","","1195-1205","","12","6","","J Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26535060 PMCID: PMC4622849","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P93WE2J6/Ewald et al. - 2015 - Vertical Targeting of AKT and mTOR as Well as Dual.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535060","","mTOR; AKT; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MEK.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These EGFR-dependent tumors eventually become TKI resistant, and the common secondary T790M mutation accounts for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib. However, the key proapoptotic proteins involved in TKI-induced cell death and other secondary mutations involved in resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis and secondary resistant mutations that affect this process. Methods and Findings To study TKI-induced cell death and mechanisms of resistance, we used lung cancer cell lines (with or without EGFR mutations), Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with EGFR mutation constructs, and tumor samples from a gefitinib-resistant patient. Here we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only polypeptide BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11) correlated with gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. The T790M mutation blocked gefitinib-induced up-regulation of BIM and apoptosis. This blockade was overcome by the irreversible TKI CL-387,785. Knockdown of BIM by small interfering RNA was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, from a gefitinib-resistant patient carrying the activating L858R mutation, we identified a novel secondary resistant mutation, L747S in cis to the activating mutation, which attenuated the up-regulation of BIM and reduced apoptosis. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that BIM is involved in TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells and that both attenuation of the up-regulation of BIM and resistance to gefitinib-induced apoptosis are seen in models that contain the common EGFR T790M and the novel L747S secondary resistance mutations. These findings also suggest that induction of BIM may have a role in the treatment of TKI-resistant tumors.","2007-10-30","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","e315","","10","4","","PLOS Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/F6XYEEGA/Costa et al. - 2007 - BIM Mediates EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induce.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; EGFR signaling; Lung and intrathoracic tumors; Mutation detection; Non-small cell lung cancer; Transfection; Tyrosine kinases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the in vitro gefitinib response of four EGFR double mutants identified in untreated patients, including Q787R+L858R, E709A+G719C, T790M+L858R, and H870R+L858R. The phosphorylation profiles of EGFR and downstream effectors AKT, STAT3/5, and ERK1/2 were compared by immunoblot analyses among the single and double mutants transfected into H358 cells. Results showed that mutants responded to in vitro gefitinib treatment with different sensitivities. The G719C and L858R single mutants showed the highest gefitinib sensitivity compared with the corresponding coexisting single mutants E709A, Q787R, H870R, and T790M. The double mutants E709A+G719C, Q787R+L858R, and H870R+L858R showed attenuated responses to gefitinib in the EGFR and downstream effector phosphorylation profiles compared with G719C or L858R alone. T790M+L858R showed strong resistance to gefitinib. Clinically, the patient whose tumor contained H870R+L858R showed tumor stabilization by 250 mg oral gefitinib daily but cerebral metastasis developed 6 months later. Correlation with the in vitro phosphorylation profile of H870R+L858R suggested that treatment failure was probably due to inadequate suppression of EGFR signaling by the drug level attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid at the given oral dosage.

Here, we present a dual mechanism of AKT regulation by the ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1). We show that in cells expressing high levels of EGFR, ERRF1 inhibits growth and enhances responses to chemotherapy. This is mediated in part through the negative regulation of AKT signaling by direct ERRFI1-dependent inhibition of EGFR. In cells expressing low levels of EGFR, ERRFI1 positively modulates AKT signaling by interfering with the interaction of the inactivating phosphatase PHLPP with AKT, thereby promoting cell growth and chemotherapy desensitization. These observations broaden our understanding of chemotherapy response and have important implications for the selection of targeted therapies in a cell context-dependent manner. EGFR inhibition can only sensitize EGFR-high cells for chemotherapy, while AKT inhibition increases chemosensitivity in EGFR-low cells. By understanding these mechanisms, we can take advantage of the cellular context to individualize antineoplastic therapy. Finally, our data also suggest targeting of EFFRI1 in EGFR-low cancer as a promising therapeutic approach.","2018-03-01","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","e44767","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A3FZ2EF4/2018 - Differential roles of ERRFI1 in EGFR and AKT pathw.pdf","","","AKT; AKT inhibitor; EGFR; ERRFI1; PHLPP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore, an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-α, E545K, and H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses, suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-α.

We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner.

We observed that KLF4 was overexpressed in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells and tissues. Knockdown of KLF4 increased tumorigenic properties in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines without c-Met overexpression, but it reduced tumorigenic properties and increased gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with c-Met overexpression, whereas overexpression of KLF4 reduced gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that KLF4 contributed to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins under gefitinib treatment and activating the c-Met/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing the inhibition of β-catenin on phosphorylation of c-Met to prevent blockade by gefitinib.

EPH receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and modulate a diverse range of developmental processes and human diseases. However, the role of C1GALT1 in the signaling of EPH receptors remains largely overlooked. Here, we showed that C1GALT1 high expression in gastric adenocarcinomas correlated with adverse clinicopathologic features and is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. Silencing or loss of C1GALT1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, as well as increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil in AGS and MKN45 cells. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis showed that C1GALT1 depletion suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 induced by soluble Ephrin A1-Fc. O-glycans on EPHA2 were modified by C1GALT1 and both S277A and T429A mutants, which are O-glycosites on EPHA2, dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Y588, suggesting that not only overall O-glycan structures but also site-specific O-glycosylation can regulate EPHA2 activity. Furthermore, depletion of C1GALT1 decreased Ephrin A1-Fc induced migration and reduced Ephrin A1 binding to cell surfaces. The effects of C1GALT1 knockdown or knockout on cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo were phenocopied by EPHA2 knockdown in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that C1GALT1 promotes phosphorylation of EPHA2 and enhances soluble Ephrin A1-mediated migration primarily by modifying EPHA2 O-glycosylation.

Heterogeneity along the EMT spectrum is observed between and within tumors. To develop effective therapeutics, a mechanistic understanding of how EMT affects the molecular requirements for proliferation is needed. We found that although cells use phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) for proliferation in both the epithelial and mesenchymal states, EMT rewires the mechanism of PI3K pathway activation. In epithelial cells, autocrine ERBB3 activation maintains PI3K signaling, whereas after EMT, downregulation of ERBB3 disrupts autocrine signaling to PI3K. Loss of ERBB3 leads to reduced serum-independent proliferation after EMT that can be rescued through reactivation of PI3K by enhanced signaling from p110α, ERBB3 reexpression, or growth factor stimulation. In vivo, we demonstrate that PIK3CA expression is upregulated in mesenchymal tumors with low levels of ERBB3. This study defines how ERBB3 downregulation after EMT affects PI3K-dependent proliferation. Significance: This study describes a mechanism through which EMT transition alters the proliferative potential of cells by modulating ERBB3 expression.

In this present study, we report that SH003, an herbal formulation, induces ER stress via PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling in GC. SH003-mediated ER stress inhibits G9a, a histone methyltransferase, by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation and activates autophagy, indicating to the dissociation of Beclin-1 and autophagy initiation from Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex. However, the inhibition of PERK and CHOP inhibited SH003-induced cell death and autophagy activation. Moreover, targeting autophagy using specific siRNAs of LC3B or p62 or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA also inhibited SH003-induced cell death in GC. Interestingly, SH003 induces BNIP3-mediated autophagic cell death under hypoxia than normoxia in GC. These findings reveal that SH003-induced ER stress regulates BNIP3-induced autophagic cell death via inhibition of STAT3-G9a axis under hypoxia in GC.

A KRAS-specific DARPin fused to the VHL E3 ligase is compared to a pan-RAS intracellular single domain antibody (iDAb) fused to the UBOX domain of the CHIP E3 ligase. We demonstrate that while the KRAS-specific DARPin degrader induces specific proteolysis of both mutant and wild type KRAS, it only inhibits proliferation of cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS in vitro and in vivo.

MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2’s predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS’s unique effector specificity for SHOC2–PP1. MRAS, SHOC2, and PPP1CB are mutated in Noonan syndrome, and we show that syndromic mutations invariably promote complex formation with each other, but not necessarily with other interactors.

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/W57Z9ILH/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, Akt signaling has been linked to resistance to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in sarcoma, further demonstrating the role of Akt in tumor survival. This suggests targeting components of the PI3K/Akt pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the in vitro activity of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Buparlisib inhibited activation of Akt and signaling molecules downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) in Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Anti-proliferative effects were observed in both anchorage dependent and independent conditions and apoptosis was induced within 24 hours of drug treatment. Buparlisib demonstrated cytotoxicity as a single agent, but was found to be more effective when used in combination. Synergy was observed when buparlisib was combined with the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The addition of NVP-AEW541 also further reduced phospho-Akt levels and more potently induced apoptosis compared to buparlisib treatment alone. Additionally, the combination of buparlisib with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib resulted in synergy in sarcoma cell lines possessing MAPK pathway mutations. Taken together, these data indicate buparlisib could be a novel therapy for the treatment of pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas.","2015-09-24","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","e0133610","","9","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7G52CFGJ/Anderson et al. - 2015 - Evaluation of In Vitro Activity of the Class I PI3.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancers and neoplasms; Drug therapy; Ewing sarcoma; Immunoblot analysis; MAPK signaling cascades; Pediatrics; Sarcoma cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, is importantly recognized as intracellular remodeling mechanism of cellular organelles during muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation. Treatment with MitoQ or rapamycin impaired both phosphorylation of ULK1 and expression of Atg proteins.

Here, we show that activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway tightly regulates PD-L1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Both oncogenic and IFNγ-mediated induction of PD-L1 was dependent on mTOR. In human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, membranous expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with mTOR activation. These data suggest that oncogenic activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway promotes immune escape by driving expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer where an mTOR inhibitor combined with a PD-1 antibody decreased tumor growth, increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, and decreased regulatory T cells.

In contrast, tumor cells expressing both CDK4 and CDK6 have increased reliance on CDK6 to ensure cell cycle progression. We discovered that CDK4/6is and CDK4/6 degraders potently bind and inhibit CDK6 selectively in tumors in which CDK6 is highly thermo-unstable and strongly associated with the HSP90–CDC37 complex. In contrast, CDK4/6is and CDK4/6 degraders are ineffective in antagonizing tumor cells expressing thermostable CDK6, due to their weaker binding to CDK6 in these cells.

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational–experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to osmotic stress, as well as by signals acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For proper adaptation, the action of these kinases must be coordinated. To identify second messengers of stress adaptation, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics profiling analysis, quantifying nearly 300 metabolites in the yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the MAPK Hog1. Ectopic addition of these BCAA derivatives promotes phosphorylation of the G protein α subunit and dampens G protein-dependent transcription, similar to that seen in response to osmotic stress. Conversely, genetic ablation of Hog1 activity or the BCAA-regulatory enzymes leads to diminished phosphorylation of Gα and increased transcription.

Here we show that vesicular RANK, which is secreted from the maturing osteoclasts, binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signalling, which activates Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). The proline-rich motif in the RANKL cytoplasmic tail is required for reverse signalling, and a RANKL(Pro29Ala) point mutation reduces activation of the reverse signalling pathway. The coupling of bone resorption and formation is disrupted in RANKL(Pro29Ala) mutant mice, indicating that osteoblastic RANKL functions as a coupling signal acceptor that recognizes vesicular RANK. RANKL reverse signalling is therefore a potential pharmacological target for avoiding the reduced bone formation associated with inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.","2018-09","2021-09-11 19:05:39","2021-09-11 19:05:44","2021-09-11 19:05:39","195-200","","7722","561","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7722 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Antibody fragment therapy;Extracellular signalling molecules;Osteoporosis Subject_term_id: antibody-fragment-therapy;extracellular-signalling-molecules;osteoporosis","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VT843WNK/Ikebuchi et al. - 2018 - Coupling of bone resorption and formation by RANKL.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ82H54G/s41586-018-0482-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around half of all breast cancers with HER2 overexpression co-express hormone receptors (HR) such as those for estrogen and progesterone. Aberrant signaling through HER2 and other members of the HER-family mediates endocrine-resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer. On the other hand, ERα co-expression has been shown to attenuate the efficiency of anti-HER2 therapies. These findings indicate that HER2 and ERα synergize to escape from both anti-ERα and anti-HER2-targeted therapies. Rationally designed clinical trials that combine endocrine therapy with anti-HER2 agents to interfere with HER2/ERα cross-talk have been conducted. However, the outcome of these trials suggests that novel therapeutic approaches are needed to further improve inhibition of HER2 and other HER-family members in conjunction with a more efficient ERα blockade. Here, we demonstrate that carfilzomib and bortezomib stabilize the HER2-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 leading to decreased HER2 autophosphorylation, reduced HER2 activity and subsequently attenuated activation of the PI3K/Akt-pathway, together with blockade of ERα expression. We further observed that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) reverse autophosphorylation and thereby inhibit the activity of constitutively active mutant HER2. We also demonstrate that PIs cause cell death in lapatinib and endocrine-resistant HER2+/ER+ breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that PIs might have the potential to improve the management of HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patients by efficiently disrupting the bi-directional HER2/ERα cross-talk.","2017-09-01","2021-09-11 19:25:04","2021-09-11 19:25:06","2021-09-11 19:25:04","72281-72301","","42","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","eng","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 29069787 PMCID: PMC5641130","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RPJRXRI9/Thaler et al. - 2017 - Proteasome inhibitors prevent bi-directional HER2.pdf","","","Breast Cancer Therapy; Er+/her2+ Breast Cancer; Proteasome inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrate, using several human and mouse models of PDACs, rapid acquisition of tumor resistance in response to targeting KRAS or MEK, associated with integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-mediated increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 component Rictor, and AKT. Although inhibition of mTORC1/2 results in a compensatory increase in ERK phosphorylation, combinatorial treatment of PDAC cells with either KRAS (G12C) or MEK inhibitors, together with mTORC1/2 inhibitors, results in synergistic cytotoxicity and cell death reflected by inhibition of pERK and pRictor/pAKT and of downstream regulators of protein synthesis and cell survival. Relative to single agents alone, this combination leads to durable inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic progression in vivo and increased survival. We have identified an effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, which can be applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations.","2020-11-17","2021-09-11 21:34:59","2021-09-11 21:35:03","","100131","","8","1","","Cell Rep Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33294856 PMCID: PMC7691443","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DZKSHWGF/Brown et al. - 2020 - Overcoming Adaptive Resistance to KRAS and MEK Inh.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294856","","signal transduction; acquired resistance; AMG 510; cellular toxicity; KRAS; PDAC; protein translation; tumor regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation by most RTKs and might provide a common resistance node. We found that combining the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 with a MEKi inhibited the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. PTPN11 knockdown/MEKi treatment had similar effects, whereas expressing SHP099 binding–defective PTPN11 mutants conferred resistance, demonstrating that SHP099 is on-target. SHP099/trametinib was highly efficacious in xenograft and/or genetically engineered models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, lung, and ovarian cancers and in wild-type RAS-expressing triple-negative breast cancer. SHP099 inhibited activation of KRAS mutants with residual GTPase activity, impeded SOS/RAS/MEK/ERK1/2 reactivation in response to MEKi, and blocked ERK1/2-dependent transcriptional programs. We conclude that SHP099/MEKi combinations could have therapeutic utility in multiple malignancies.

By searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2. DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38α MAPK. The activated S6K1 forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response and likely in tumorigenesis.

How cancer cells bypass inhibition to prevent maximal response to therapy is not understood. Because KRAS(G12C) cycles between an active and inactive conformation4–6, and the inhibitors bind only to the latter, we tested whether isogenic cell populations respond in a non-uniform manner by studying the effect of treatment at a single-cell resolution. Here we report that, shortly after treatment, some cancer cells are sequestered in a quiescent state with low KRAS activity, whereas others bypass this effect to resume proliferation. This rapid divergent response occurs because some quiescent cells produce new KRAS(G12C) in response to suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase output. New KRAS(G12C) is maintained in its active, drug-insensitive state by epidermal growth factor receptor and aurora kinase signalling. Cells without these adaptive changes—or cells in which these changes are pharmacologically inhibited—remain sensitive to drug treatment, because new KRAS(G12C) is either not available or exists in its inactive, drug-sensitive state. The direct targeting of KRAS oncoproteins has been a longstanding objective in precision oncology. Our study uncovers a flexible non-uniform fitness mechanism that enables groups of cells within a population to rapidly bypass the effect of treatment.

In vitro, sensitivity of KRAS-mutant cells toward the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, is not apparent when cells are grown on plastic in 2D monolayer, but is revealed when cells are grown as 3D multicellular spheroids. This antitumor activity is also observed in vivo in mouse models. Interrogation of the MAPK pathway in SHP099-treated KRAS-mutant cancer models demonstrated similar modulation of p-ERK and DUSP6 transcripts in 2D, 3D, and in vivo, suggesting a MAPK pathway–dependent mechanism and possible non-MAPK pathway–dependent mechanisms in tumor cells or tumor microenvironment for the in vivo efficacy. For the KRASG12C MIAPaCa-2 model, we demonstrate that the efficacy is cancer cell intrinsic as there is minimal antiangiogenic activity by SHP099, and the effects of SHP099 is recapitulated by genetic depletion of SHP2 in cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP099 efficacy in KRAS-mutant models can be recapitulated with RTK inhibitors, suggesting RTK activity is responsible for the SHP2 activation.

To identify differential therapeutic sensitivities between epithelial and mesenchymal lung tumors, we performed in vivo small hairpin RNA screens, proteomic profiling, and analysis of patient tumor datasets, which revealed an inverse correlation between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling dependency and a zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)-regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies determined that MAPK signaling dependency in epithelial lung cancer cells is due to the scaffold protein interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD), which is directly repressed by ZEB1. Lung tumors in multiple Kras mutant murine models with increased ZEB1 displayed low IL17RD expression, accompanied by MAPK-independent tumor growth and therapeutic resistance to MEK inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 function with miR-200 expression or the histone deacetylase inhibitor mocetinostat sensitized resistant cancer cells to MEK inhibition and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth, showing a promising combinatorial treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. In human lung tumor samples, high ZEB1 and low IL17RD expression correlated with low MAPK signaling, presenting potential markers that predict patient response to MEK inhibitors.","2019-03-13","2021-09-11 22:15:24","2021-09-11 22:15:24","","eaaq1238","","483","11","","Sci Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30867319 PMCID: PMC6878763","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/372MF6DA/Peng et al. - 2019 - ZEB1 suppression sensitizes KRAS mutant cancers to.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867319","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Humans; Mice; Benzamides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial Cells; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mesoderm; MicroRNAs; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Mutation; Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Pyrimidines; Receptors, Interleukin-17; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These were PDX models harboring primary and secondary KIT and additional mutations; KIT exon 11 (p.Y570_L576del), KIT exon 17 (p.D816E), and PTEN (p.T321fs) mutations in GIST-RX1 from a patient who was unresponsive to imatinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib, and KIT exon 11 (p.K550_splice) and KIT exon 14 (p.T670I) mutations in GIST-RX2 and KIT exon 9 (p.502_503insYA) and KIT exon 17 (p.D820E) mutations in GIST-RX4 from patients with imatinib and imatinib/sunitinib resistance, respectively. The histological features and mutation statuses of GIST PDXs were consistent with those of the original patient tumors, and the models showed TKI sensitivity comparable to clinical responses. Imatinib inhibited the KIT pathway in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 but not GIST-RX1, RX2, and RX4. These GIST PDX models will be useful for studying TKI resistance mechanisms and evaluating novel targeted agents in GIST.","2017-09-11","2021-09-11 23:13:19","2021-09-11 23:13:26","","","","","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/C2ZP8EQL/Na et al. - 2017 - Establishment and characterization of patient-deri.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319657318_Establishment_and_characterization_of_patient-derived_xenograft_models_of_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_resistant_to_standard_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CK6 did not result in significant anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects in any of the GIST models, and moreover, CK6 did not induce a remarkable inhibition of KIT activation. Furthermore, no synergistic effect of combining CK6 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was observed. Conversely, in certain GIST xenografts, anti-tumor effects seemed to be inferior under combination treatment compared to single-agent TKI treatment. In the GIST xenografts tested, the anti-tumor efficacy of CK6 was limited. No synergy was observed on combination of CK6 with TKIs in these GIST models.

The development of effective salvage treatments is complicated by the heterogeneity of KIT secondary resistance mutations. Recently, additional mutations that independently activate KIT-downstream signaling have been found in pretreated patients—adding further complexity to the scope of resistance. We collected genotyping data for KIT from tumor samples of pretreated GIST, providing a representative overview on the distribution and incidence of secondary KIT mutations (n = 80). Analyzing next-generation sequencing data of 109 GIST, we found that 18% carried mutations in KIT-downstream signaling intermediates (NF1/2, PTEN, RAS, PIK3CA, TSC1/2, AKT, BRAF) potentially mediating resistance to KIT inhibitors. Notably, we found no apparent other driver mutations in refractory cases that were analyzed by whole exome/genome sequencing (13/109). Using CRISPR/Cas9 methods, we generated a panel of GIST cell lines harboring mutations in KIT, PTEN, KRAS, NF1, and TSC2. We utilized this panel to evaluate sapanisertib, a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, as a salvage strategy. Sapanisertib had potent antiproliferative effects in all cell lines, including those with KIT-downstream mutations. Combinations with KIT or MEK inhibitors completely abrogated GIST-survival signaling and displayed synergistic effects. Our isogenic cell line panel closely approximates the genetic heterogeneity of resistance observed in heavily pretreated patients with GIST. With the clinical development of novel, broad spectrum KIT inhibitors, emergence of non-KIT–related resistance may require combination treatments with inhibitors of KIT-downstream signaling such as mTOR or MEK.","2019-11-01","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:52","1985-1996","","11","18","","Mol Cancer Ther","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mct-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Small Molecule Therapeutics PMID: 31308077","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CSPSM55N/Mühlenberg et al. - 2019 - KIT-Dependent and KIT-Independent Genomic Heteroge.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in GISTs and impact KIT expression. Little is known though on KIT-independent targets of KIT-regulating mRNAs. We sought to investigate how miR-494 inhibits GIST proliferation and to identify novel target gene. We used microarray-based gene expression analyses to identify pathways and target genes affected by miR-494. The expressional relationship between survivin and miR-494 was determined in 35 GIST tissues. Cell proliferation assay, FACS analysis, colony formation assay, promoter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) were performed to clarify the roles of survivin in GIST progression. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that miR-494 inhibited GISTs by affecting multiple genes in the cell cycle pathway. Survivin (BIRC5) was a key target of miR-494, and its expression showed an inverse correlation with miR-494 expression in 35 GIST tissues (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = −0.418, p = 0.012). Downregulation of survivin inhibited proliferation and colony formation, and resulted in cell cycle alteration. Induced survivin overexpression relieved miR-494-mediated inhibition of GIST progression. Targeting PI3K effectively suppressed proliferation of GISTs with downregulation of survivin. Survivin also regulated KIT expression at the transcription level. Immunohistochemical analysis using 113 GISTs revealed that survivin expression was significantly correlated with overall survival of GIST patients (p = 0.004). Our findings indicated that miR-494 synergistically suppressed GISTs by concomitantly targeting survivin and KIT.","2018","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2080-2093","","10","142","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.31235","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8ABEBK4F/Yun et al. - 2018 - Survivin is a novel transcription regulator of KIT.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U3WCEKVH/ijc.html","","","gastrointestinal stromal tumor; KIT; miR-494; survivin; vertical blockade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the ERBB2 receptor have recently been reported in breast cancer at diagnosis and also in gastric, colorectal and lung cancer. These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002. Conclusions/Significance Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations. Irreversible ERBB2 inhibitors may offer alternative treatment options for breast cancer and other solid tumor patients harbouring lapatinib resistance mutations. In addition, these inhibitors may be of interest in the scenario of secondary lapatinib resistance.","2011-10-28","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","e26760","","10","6","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JIQCFJFV/Kancha et al. - 2011 - Differential Sensitivity of ERBB2 Kinase Domain Mu.pdf","","","Cancer treatment; Breast cancer; Binding analysis; Cell binding assay; Crystal structure; Gastric cancer; Insertion mutation; Point mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CYH33 potently restrained tumor growth in mice bearing human breast cancer cell xenografts and in R26-Pik3caH1047R;MMTV-Cre transgenic mice. CYH33 significantly inhibited proliferation of a panel of human breast cancer cells, while diversity in sensitivity has been observed. Cells harboring activating PIK3CA mutation, amplified HER2 were more responsive to CYH33 than their counterparts. Besides, cells in HER2-enriched or luminal subtype were more sensitive to CYH33 than basal-like breast cancer. Sensitivity to CYH33 has been further revealed to be associated with induction of G1 phase arrest and simultaneous inhibition of Akt and ERK. Sensitivity of patient-derived xenograft to CYH33 was also positively correlated with decrease in phosphorylated ERK. Taken together, CYH33 is a promising PI3Kα inhibitor for breast cancer treatment and decrease in ERK phosphorylation may indicate its efficacy, which provides useful clues for rational design of the ongoing clinical trials.","2018-10-01","2021-09-11 23:20:29","2021-09-11 23:20:29","2021-09-11 23:20:29","273-282","","","433","","Cancer Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","HER2; Akt; Patient-derived xenograft (PDX)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both caused inhibition of AKT, relief of feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, and growth arrest. However, only the PI3K inhibitors caused rapid induction of cell death. In seeking a mechanism for this phenomenon, we found that PI3K inhibition, but not AKT inhibition, causes rapid inhibition of wild-type RAS and of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Inhibition of RAS–ERK signaling is transient, rebounding a few hours after drug addition, and is required for rapid induction of apoptosis. Combined MEK and AKT inhibition also promotes cell death, and in murine models of HER2+ cancer, either pulsatile PI3K inhibition or combined MEK and AKT inhibition causes tumor regression. We conclude that PI3K is upstream of RAS and AKT and that pulsatile inhibition of both pathways is sufficient for effective antitumor activity. Significance: We show that the RAS–ERK pathway is a key downstream effector pathway of oncogenic PI3K. Coordinate downregulation of AKT and ERK is necessary for induction of apoptosis and antitumor activity and can be accomplished with pulsatile dosing, which will likely decrease toxicity and allow administration of therapeutic doses.

We sought to discover predictive biomarker for the efficacy of BYL719 by dissecting the proliferative signaling pathway mediated by PI3K in breast cancer. BYL719 concurrently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in PIK3CA-mutated human breast cancer cells. PI3K-regulated ERK phosphorylation was independent of canonical PDK1/AKT/mTOR pathway, while it was associated with RAF/MEK. Hyper-activation of EGFR or RAS abrogated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by BYL719. Furthermore, hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, c-MET, FGFR and HER3 but not IGF-1R restored ERK phosphorylation and cell viability suppressed by BYL719, suggesting the discriminative functions of RTKs in cell signaling and proliferation. By profiling 22 breast cancer cell lines, we found that BYL719 was more potent in cell lines where phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK was attenuated than those where only AKT phosphorylation was inhibited. The potency of BYL719 was further found to be significantly correlated with the expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer cells. Specifically, overexpression of EGFR, c-MET and/or FGFR1 forecasted resistance, while overexpression of IGF-1R and/or HER2 predicted sensitivity to BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Similar correlation between BYL719 efficacy and expression profile of RTKs was found in patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer. Thus, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 contributes to its antitumor efficacy and is determined by the converged signaling from RTKs. The expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer tissue could be potentially developed as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors.","2017","2021-09-11 23:22:25","2021-09-11 23:22:30","2021-09-11 23:22:25","974-986","","4","7","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HDGXBRNF/Xu et al. - 2017 - Integration of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Determine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intriguingly, this function of KDM4B on UPR requires its demethylase activity but is independent of its canonical role in histone modification, and acts through its cytoplasmic interaction with eIF2α, a crucial component of UPR signaling, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of this component.

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:27","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/274AZF92/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PSGJGQVZ/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, potential molecular mechanisms by which resistance to this class of drugs occurs have not been investigated. Parsaclisib (INCB050465) is a potent and selective next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitor that differs in structure from first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors and has shown encouraging anti–B-cell tumor activity and reduced hepatotoxicity in phase 1/2 clinical studies. Here, we present preclinical data demonstrating parsaclisib as a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ with over 1000-fold selectivity against other class 1 PI3K isozymes. Parsaclisib directly blocks PI3K signaling–mediated cell proliferation in B-cell lines in vitro and in vivo and indirectly controls tumor growth by lessening immunosuppression through regulatory T-cell inhibition in a syngeneic lymphoma model. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines overexpressing MYC were insensitive to proliferation blockade via PI3Kδ signaling inhibition by parsaclisib, but their proliferative activities were reduced by suppression of MYC gene transcription. Molecular structure analysis of the first- and next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors combined with clinical observation suggests that hepatotoxicity seen with the first-generation inhibitors could result from a structure-related off-target effect. Parsaclisib is currently being evaluated in multiple phase 2 clinical trials as a therapy against various hematologic malignancies of B-cell origin (NCT03126019, NCT02998476, NCT03235544, NCT03144674, and NCT02018861). SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The preclinical properties described here provide the mechanism of action and support clinical investigations of parsaclisib as a therapy for B-cell malignancies. MYC overexpression was identified as a resistance mechanism to parsaclisib in DLBCL cells, which may be useful in guiding further translational studies for the selection of patients with DLBCL who might benefit from PI3Kδ inhibitor treatment in future trials. Hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors may be an off-target effect of that class of compounds.","2020-07-01","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","211-222","","1","374","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 by The Author(s).

PI3Kδ has been validated as a promising target for cancer therapy, and specific PI3Kδ inhibitors were approved for clinical practice. However, the substantial toxicity and relatively low efficacy as a monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) limit their clinical use. In this study, we described a novel PI3Kδ inhibitor SAF-248, which exhibited high selectivity for PI3Kδ (IC50 = 30.6 nM) over other PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels, while sparing most of the other human protein kinases in the kinome profiling. SAF-248 exhibited superior antiproliferative activity against 27 human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines compared with the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib. In particular, SAF-248 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of seven DLBCL cell lines (with GI50 values < 1 μM in 5 DLBCL cell lines). We demonstrated that SAF-248 concentration-dependently blocked PI3K signaling followed by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL KARPAS-422, Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Its activity against the DLBCL cells was negatively correlated to the protein level of PI3Kα. Oral administration of SAF-248 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Activation of mTORC1, MYC and JAK/STAT signaling was observed upon prolonged treatment and co-targeting these pathways would potentiate the activity of SAF-248. Taken together, SAF-248 is a promising selective PI3Kδ inhibitor for the treatment of DLBCL and rational drug combination would further improve its efficacy.","2021-03-29","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","1-11","","","","","Acta Pharmacol Sin","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to CPS and SIMM","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4 inhibitors for PEL.","2016-04-01","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","1797-1810","","14","35","","Oncogene","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 26119939 PMCID: PMC4486341","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YFSGJWJW/Gopalakrishnan et al. - 2016 - Immunomodulatory drugs target IKZF1-IRF4-MYC axis .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes.

However, little is known about the effect of sauchinone on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of sauchinone and the underlying mechanism using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model. Sauchinone markedly suppressed FcεRI-mediated activation of positive signaling mediators, including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), phospholipase C (PLC)γ, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Akt, IκB kinase (IKK), and intracellular Ca2+, and increased the activation of negative signaling mediators, including liver kinase B (LKB)1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. Interestingly, sauchinone increased the interaction between SHP-1 and Syk. Consequently, sauchinone significantly suppressed FcεRI-mediated BMMC degranulation and synthesis of eicosanoids and cytokines. These inhibitory effects of sauchinone were diminished in BMMCs treated with siRNAs targeting LKB1, AMPKα2, or SHP-1, and in BMMCs isolated from AMPKα2-deficient mice. In addition, administration of sauchinone markedly suppressed the IgE-mediated PCA reaction in wild-type mice, and this inhibitory effect was significantly reduced in AMPKα2−/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that sauchinone suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis through modulation of the LKB1/AMPK and SHP-1/Syk pathways. Therefore, sauchinone might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.","2019-09-01","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","105702","","","74","","International Immunopharmacology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; Allergy; Mast cell; Sauchinone; Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show here that suckling-weaning and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the glucagon/insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK. Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion under limited-glucose conditions, whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both insulin and glucagon induced AMPKα phosphorylation at its Ser485/491 residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic energy charge.

Here, using rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model, we found that DHA reduced cell proliferation and viability in RMS cells, but not those in normal cells, which was associated with inhibition of mTORC1. Mechanistically, DHA did not bind to mTOR or FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12). In addition, DHA neither inhibited insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (Erk1/2), nor activated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the cells. Rather, DHA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK, ectopic expression dominant negative or kinase-dead AMPK, or knockdown of AMPKa attenuated the inhibitory effect of DHA on mTORC1 in the cells. Additionally, DHA was able to induce dissociation of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor) from mTOR and inhibit mTORC1 activity. Moreover, treatment with artesunate, a prodrug of DHA, dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and concurrently activated AMPK and suppressed mTORC1 in RMS xenografts.

Here, we show that curcumin concentration- and time-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and their downstream substrates in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and this inhibitory effect acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or disruption of TSC1-TSC2 complex by small interfering RNA or gene knockout only partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream signaling, indicating that they are not the primary effectors of curcumin-mediated inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition of these kinases failed to rescue the inhibition by curcumin.

Endogenous Sestrins maintain insulin-dependent AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation during high-fat diet–induced obesity, and overexpressed Sestrins activate AKT in various cell types, including liver and skeletal muscle cells. Although Sestrin-mediated AKT activation improves metabolic parameters, the mechanistic details underlying such improvement remain elusive. Here, we investigated how Sestrin2, the Sestrin homolog highly expressed in liver, induces strong AKT activation. We found that two known targets of Sestrin2, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, are not required for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Rather, phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, kinases upstream of AKT, were essential for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Among these kinases, mTORC2 catalytic activity was strongly up-regulated upon Sestrin2 overexpression in an <i>in vitro</i> kinase assay, indicating that mTORC2 may represent the major link between Sestrin2 and AKT. As reported previously, Sestrin2 interacted with mTORC2; however, we found here that this interaction occurs indirectly through GATOR2, a pentameric protein complex that directly interacts with Sestrin2. Deleting or silencing WDR24 (WD repeat domain 24), the GATOR2 component essential for the Sestrin2–GATOR2 interaction, or WDR59, the GATOR2 component essential for the GATOR2–mTORC2 interaction, completely ablated Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. We also noted that Sestrin2 also directly binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT and induces AKT translocation to the plasma membrane.

The cellular energy sensor and regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was suggested as a putative mediator of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, the leading anthracycline drug, by our earlier work. Here, we study the interference of doxorubicin with AMPK signalling and potentially involved mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of doxorubicin on cell signalling are studied in isolated Langendorff-perfused Wistar rat hearts and in hearts from doxorubicin-treated Wistar rats. In both models, doxorubicin induces energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress. Despite energy depletion and unaffected AMPK upstream signalling, doxorubicin does not activate the AMPK pathway and even reduces basal phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In contrast, oxidative and genotoxic stress do activate pro-survival mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways, the latter via DNA-dependent protein kinase activation triggered by DNA damage. Combined inhibition of AMPK and activation of Akt and MAPK lead to activation of growth-stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the doxorubicin-challenged heart, a combined energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress elicits a specific, hierarchical response where AMPK is inhibited at least partially by the known negative cross-talk with Akt and MAPK pathways, largely triggered by DNA damage signalling. Although such signalling can be protective, e.g. by limiting apoptosis, it primarily induces a negative feedback that increases cellular energy deficits, and via activation of mTOR signalling, it also contributes to the pathological cardiac phenotype in chronic doxorubicin toxicity.","2012-08-01","2021-09-11 23:37:47","2021-09-11 23:37:47","","290-299","","3","95","","Cardiovasc Res","Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22461523","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AP6WY58S/Gratia et al. - 2012 - Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin at t.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461523","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Enzyme Activation; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Disease Models, Animal; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; DNA Damage; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Energy Metabolism; Heart Diseases; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions.

However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.","2009-09-01","2021-09-11 23:42:25","2021-09-11 23:42:25","","6941-50","","","69","","Cancer research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5NBXCPGY/Mühlenberg et al. - 2009 - Inhibitors of Deacetylases Suppress Oncogenic KIT .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26766848_Inhibitors_of_Deacetylases_Suppress_Oncogenic_KIT_Signaling_Acetylate_HSP90_and_Induce_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dramatic metabolic responses following imatinib treatment indicate a high, KIT-dependent glucose turnover which has been particularly helpful for predicting tumor response to imatinib. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibits glucose metabolism in cancer cells that depend on aerobic glycolysis for ATP production. We show that 2DG inhibits proliferation in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines at levels that can be achieved clinically. KIT-negative GIST48B have 3-14-fold higher IC50 levels than KIT-positive GIST cells indicating that oncogenic KIT may sensitize cells to 2DG. GIST sensitivity to 2DG is increased in low-glucose media (110mg/dl). 2DG leads to dose- and glucose dependent inhibition of KIT glycosylation with resultant reduction of membrane-bound KIT, inhibition of KIT-phosphorylation and inactivation of KIT-dependent signaling intermediates. In contrast to imatinib, 2DG caused ER-stress and elicited the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mannose but not pyruvate rescued GIST cells from 2DG-induced growth arrest, suggesting that loss of KIT integrity is the predominant effect of 2DG in GIST. Additive anti-tumoral effects were seen with imatinib and BH3-mimetics. Our data provide the first evidence that modulation of the glucose-metabolism by 2DG may have a disease-specific effect and may be therapeutically useful in GIST.","2015-03-17","2021-09-11 23:42:51","2021-09-11 23:42:51","","e0120531","","","10","","PloS one","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BYWNTNCH/Mühlenberg et al. - 2015 - Inhibition of KIT-Glycosylation by 2-Deoxyglucose .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273786413_Inhibition_of_KIT-Glycosylation_by_2-Deoxyglucose_Abrogates_KIT-Signaling_and_Combination_with_ABT-263_Synergistically_Induces_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as the second and third line therapies to overcome some of these drug-resistance mutations; however, their limited clinical response, toxicity and resistance of the activation loop mutants still makes new therapies bearing different cKIT mutants activity spectrum profile highly demanded. Through a drug repositioning approach, we found that cabozantinib exhibited higher potency than imatinib against primary gain-of-function mutations of cKIT. Moreover, cabozantinib was able to overcome cKIT gatekeeper T670I mutation and the activation loop mutations that are resistant to imatinib or sunitinib. Cabozantinib demonstrated good efficacy in vitro and in vivo in the cKIT mutant-driven preclinical models of GISTs while displaying a long-lasting effect after treatment withdrawal.

Considering clinical safety and PK profile of cabozantinib, this report provides the basis for the future clinical applications of cabozantinib as an alternative anti-GISTs therapy in precision medicine.","2019-04-10","2021-09-11 23:44:26","2021-09-11 23:44:26","2021-09-11 23:44:26","105-114","","","447","","Cancer Letters","Repurposing cabozantinib to GISTs","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Activation loop mutants; cKIT T670I mutant; Drug resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The histological features and mutation statuses of GIST PDXs were consistent with those of the original patient tumors, and the models showed TKI sensitivity comparable to clinical responses. Imatinib inhibited the KIT pathway in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 but not GIST-RX1, RX2, and RX4. These GIST PDX models will be useful for studying TKI resistance mechanisms and evaluating novel targeted agents in GIST.","2017-09-11","2021-09-11 23:44:44","2021-09-11 23:44:44","","","","","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q2J4NERQ/Na et al. - 2017 - Establishment and characterization of patient-deri.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319657318_Establishment_and_characterization_of_patient-derived_xenograft_models_of_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_resistant_to_standard_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imatinib-resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and little is known about KIT functional roles in imatinib-resistant GIST. Biological consequences of biochemical inhibition of KIT, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), PLCgamma, MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK were determined by immunoblotting for protein activation, and by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in GIST cell lines from imatinib-sensitive GIST (GIST882), imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST430 and GIST48) and KIT-negative GIST (GIST62). KIT activation was 3- to 6-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48 than in GIST882, whereas total KIT expression was comparable in these three GIST lines. In addition to the higher set point for KIT activation, GIST430 and GIST48 had intrinsic imatinib resistance. After treatment with 1 muM imatinib, residual KIT activation was 6- and 2.8-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48, respectively, compared to GIST882. In all GIST lines, cell growth arrest resulted from PI3-K inhibition, and - to a lesser extent - from MEK/MAPK and mTOR inhibition. Inhibition of JAK/STAT or PLCgamma did not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, only PI3-K inhibition resulted in substantial apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant GISTs. We conclude that GIST secondary KIT mutations can be associated with KIT hyperactivation and imatinib resistance. Targeting critical downstream signaling proteins, such as PI3-K, is a promising therapeutic strategy in imatinib-resistant GISTs.","2007-12-01","2021-09-11 23:45:02","2021-09-11 23:45:02","","7560-8","","","26","","Oncogene","KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MEQURLTR/Bauer et al. - 2007 - KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-res.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6290596_KIT_oncogenic_signaling_mechanisms_in_imatinib-resistant_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_PI3-kinaseAKT_is_a_crucial_survival_pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ERK1/2 (ERK) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and is the terminal node of the pathway. BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies are effective in BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and lung cancers; however, responses are short-lived due to emergence of resistance. Reactivation of ERK signaling is central to the mechanisms of acquired resistance. Therefore, ERK inhibition provides an opportunity to overcome resistance and leads to improved efficacy. In addition, KRAS-mutant cancers remain an unmet medical need in which ERK inhibitors may provide treatment options alone or in combination with other agents. Here, we report identification and activity of LY3214996, a potent, selective, ATP-competitive ERK inhibitor. LY3214996 treatment inhibited the pharmacodynamic biomarker, phospho-p90RSK1, in cells and tumors, and correlated with LY3214996 exposures and antitumor activities. In in vitro cell proliferation assays, sensitivity to LY3214996 correlated with ERK pathway aberrations. LY3214996 showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and regression in xenograft models harboring ERK pathway alterations. Importantly, more than 50% target inhibition for up to 8 to 16 hours was sufficient for significant tumor growth inhibition as single agent in BRAF- and KRAS-mutant models. LY3214996 also exhibited synergistic combination benefit with a pan-RAF inhibitor in a KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer xenograft model. Furthermore, LY3214996 demonstrated antitumor activity in BRAF-mutant models with acquired resistance in vitro and in vivo.

Some evidence suggests that sestrins may inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) through inhibition of RagA/B GTPases or activation of AMPK; however, whether sestrins are also involved in mTORC2 regulation and function is unclear. To investigate the functions and mechanisms of Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), we generated Sesn3 liver-specific transgenic and knockout mice. Our data show that Sesn3 liver-specific knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and Sesn3 transgenic mice were protected against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Using AMPK liver-specific knockout mice, we demonstrate that the Sesn3 insulin-sensitizing effect is largely independent of AMPK. Biochemical analysis reveals that Sesn3 interacts with and activates mTORC2 and subsequently stimulates Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings suggest that Sesn3 can activate Akt via mTORC2 to regulate hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.","2015-04-01","2021-09-11 23:53:52","2021-09-11 23:53:57","2021-09-11 23:53:52","1211-1223","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

The signalling pathways downstream of IL11 are contentious and both STAT3 and ERK have been implicated. Here we show that TGFβ1- or IL11- induced ERK activation is consistently associated with fibrogenesis whereas STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is unrelated to fibroblast activation. Surprisingly, recombinant human IL11, which has been used extensively in mouse experiments to infer STAT3 activity downstream of IL11, non-specifically increases pSTAT3 in Il11ra1 null mouse fibroblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 prevents TGFβ1-induced fibrogenesis but this effect was found to reflect fibroblast dysfunction due to severe proteotoxic ER stress. In contrast, inhibition of MEK/ERK prevented fibrosis in the absence of ER stress. TGFβ1-stimulated ERK/mTOR/P70RSK-driven protein translation was IL11-dependent and selectivity for pro-fibrotic protein synthesis was ascribed to an EPRS-related mechanism. In TGFβ1-stimulated fibroblasts, the anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib caused dose-dependent ER stress, reduced pSTAT/pERK and inhibited pro-fibrotic protein translation, similarly to generic STAT3 inhibitors or ER stressors. Pirfenidone, while anti-fibrotic, had no effect on ER stress whereas anti-IL11 inhibited the ERK/mTOR axis while reducing ER stress. These studies discount a specific role for STAT3 in pro-fibrotic signaling, suggest a novel mechanism of action for nintedanib and prioritise further the IL11 pathway as a therapeutic target for fibrosis.","2021-06-10","2021-09-11 23:55:36","2021-09-11 23:55:37","2021-09-11 23:55:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2021.06.10.447846","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2PKUYV5C/Widjaja et al. - 2021 - Molecular dissection of pro-fibrotic signaling ide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, understanding how MYC protein stability is regulated may lead to effective therapies. Here, we used a previously developed, flow cytometry-based assay that screened a library of >800 protein kinase inhibitors and identified compounds that promoted either the stability or degradation of MYC in a KRAS-mutant PDAC cell line. We validated compounds that stabilized or destabilized MYC and then focused on one compound, UNC10112785, that induced the substantial loss of MYC protein in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell cultures. We determined that this compound is a potent CDK9 inhibitor with a previously uncharacterized scaffold, caused MYC loss through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, and suppresses PDAC anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. We discovered that CDK9 enhanced MYC protein stability through a previously unknown, KRAS-independent mechanism involving direct phosphorylation of MYC at Ser62 Our study thus not only identifies a potential therapeutic target for patients with KRAS-mutant PDAC but also presents the application of a screening strategy that can be more broadly adapted to identify regulators of protein stability.","2019-07-16","2021-09-12 00:05:09","2021-09-12 00:05:09","","eaav7259","","590","12","","Sci Signal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31311847 PMCID: PMC6728149","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MTLMAHUQ/Blake et al. - 2019 - Application of a MYC degradation screen identifies.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311847","","Phosphorylation; Humans; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Protein Stability; Proteolysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Small Molecule Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, but its regulation remains poorly defined. Here we show that depletion of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor, resulted in NLRP3- and ASC (apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain)-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 engagement. TLR2 or TLR4 agonist induced PAI-2 expression, which subsequently stabilized the autophagic protein Beclin 1 to promote autophagy, resulting in decreases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, NLRP3 protein level, and pro-IL-1β processing. Likewise, overexpressing Beclin 1 in PAI-2-deficient cells rescued the suppression of NLRP3 activation in response to LPS.

We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition repressed GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII.","2017-12-15","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","20720-20731","","50","292","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GMIUT3C4/Haj et al. - 2017 - Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 is .pdf","","","chromatin; histone modification; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); phosphorylation; pituitary gland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1–dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1–induced formation of K63-Ub chains and ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains.

RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice.

However, pharmacologically activated p53 can induce diverse responses ranging from cell death to growth arrest and DNA repair, which limits the efficient application of p53-reactivating drugs in clinic. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms defining the biological outcome upon p53 activation remains a grand challenge in the p53 field. Here, we report that concurrent pharmacological activation of p53 and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), result in the synthetic lethality in cancer cells. ROS promote the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and DNA damage response, which establishes a positive feedback loop with p53. This converts the p53-induced growth arrest/senescence to apoptosis. We identified several survival oncogenes inhibited by p53 in JNK-dependent manner, including Mcl1, PI3K, eIF4E, as well as p53 inhibitors Wip1 and MdmX. Further, we show that Wip1 is one of the crucial executors downstream of JNK whose ablation confers the enhanced and sustained p53 transcriptional response contributing to cell death. Our study provides novel insights for manipulating p53 response in a controlled way. Further, our results may enable new pharmacological strategy to exploit abnormally high ROS level, often linked with higher aggressiveness in cancer, to selectively kill cancer cells upon pharmacological reactivation of p53.","2014-04","2021-09-14 05:26:06","2021-09-14 05:26:09","2021-09-14 05:26:06","612-623","","4","21","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2014 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Cancer therapy;Pharmacology Subject_term_id: apoptosis;cancer-therapy;pharmacology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSRSI3RX/Shi et al. - 2014 - ROS-dependent activation of JNK converts p53 into .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, MYC, a potent oncogene, is an antinecroptotic factor that directly suppresses the formation of the RIPK1–RIPK3 complex. Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that the MYC pathway is the most prominently down-regulated signaling pathway during necroptosis. Depletion or deletion of MYC promotes the RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction, thereby stabilizing the RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and facilitating necroptosis. Interestingly, MYC binds to RIPK3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in vitro. Furthermore, MYC-nick, a truncated form that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, prevented TNF-induced necroptosis. Finally, down-regulation of MYC enhances necroptosis in leukemia cells and suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model upon treatment with birinapant and emricasan. MYC-mediated suppression of necroptosis is a mechanism of necroptosis resistance in cancer, and approaches targeting MYC to induce necroptosis represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer.","2020-08-18","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","19982-19993","","33","117","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/43BUNHPP/Seong et al. - 2020 - Identification of MYC as an antinecroptotic protei.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation is still unclear. Here we report that the expression of cytokines is robustly upregulated in a cell-autonomous manner during necroptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). We demonstrate that TNFα-induced necroptosis leads to two waves of cytokine production. The first wave, more transient and weaker than the second, is in response to TNFα alone; whereas the second wave depends upon the necroptotic signaling. We show that necroptosis promotes the transcription of TNFα-target genes in a cell-intrinsic manner. The activation of both NF-κB and p38 by the necroptotic machinery, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, is involved in mediating the robust induction of cytokine expression in the second wave. In contrast, necroptosis induced by direct oligomerization of MLKL promotes cytokine production at much lower levels than that of necroptosis induced with TNFα. Thus, we conclude that TNFα-induced necroptosis signaling events mediated by RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation, in addition to the MLKL oligomerization, promotes the expression of cytokines involving multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms including NF-κB pathway and p38. These findings reveal that the necroptotic cell death machinery mounts an immune response by promoting cell-autonomous production of cytokines. Our study provides insights into the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation in human diseases.","2018-04-27","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","1-16","","5","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2YPPXFNL/Zhu et al. - 2018 - Necroptosis promotes cell-autonomous activation of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Macrophages are key innate immune cells that upon encountering pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing cytokines, including IFN-β. In this study, we identify a novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing IFN-β production in macrophages. Using genetic and pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1 directs IFN-β synthesis induced by LPS in mice. Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase–dependent IFN-β production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in bone marrow–derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases. Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1 and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF–dependent IFN-β production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4. Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase–dependent synthesis of IFN-β is markedly induced by avirulent strains of Gram-negative bacteria, Yersinia and Klebsiella, and less so by their wild-type counterparts. Overall, these observations identify unexpected roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases in the production of IFN-β during the host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and suggest that the axis in which these kinases operate may represent a target for bacterial virulence factors.","2017-06-01","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","4435-4447","","11","198","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","","","","www.jimmunol.org","","Publisher: American Association of Immunologists Section: INNATE IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION PMID: 28461567","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FJB9MMXU/Saleh et al. - 2017 - Kinase Activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 Can Direct IF.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Results: MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity.

In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206–sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. Conclusions: MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

Despite this wealth of information the precise signalling timeline and effectors engaged by Ras, particularly during G1, remain obscure as approaches for Ras inhibition are slow-acting and ill-suited for charting discrete Ras signalling episodes along the cell cycle. We have developed an approach based on the inducible recruitment of a Ras-GAP that enforces endogenous Ras inhibition within minutes. Applying this strategy to inhibit Ras stepwise in synchronous cell populations revealed that Ras signaling was required well into G1 for Cyclin D induction, pocket protein phosphorylation and S-phase entry, irrespective of whether cells emerged from quiescence or G2/M. Unexpectedly, Erk, and not PI3K/Akt or Ral was activated by Ras at mid-G1, albeit PI3K/Akt signalling was a necessary companion of Ras/Erk for sustaining cyclin-D levels and G1/S transition. Our findings chart mitogenic signaling by endogenous Ras during G1 and identify limited effector engagement restricted to Raf/MEK/Erk as a cogent distinction from oncogenic Ras signalling.","2019-01-17","2021-09-14 05:58:02","2021-09-14 05:58:03","2021-09-14 05:58:02","204-225","","2","18","","Cell Cycle","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7VUAPSGY/Vasjari et al. - 2019 - Ras signals principally via Erk in G1 but cooperat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for the treatment of certain cancers, major success in targeting mTOR, particularly with new generation mTOR kinase inhibitors, for the effective treatment of cancers has not been achieved. Hence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the mTOR axis in cancer is still needed. It is now recognized that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on cancer cells is a critical mechanism contributing to immunosuppression and immune escape via interacting with program death-1 (PD-1) on immune cells. This study has revealed a previously undiscovered role of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the negative regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that disruption of this signaling pathway with mTOR inhibitors, raptor knockdown or p70S6K inhibitors elevated PD-L1 levels in some lung and other cancer cell lines. Elevation of PD-L1 by inhibition of mTORC1/p70S6K signaling is likely due to suppression of β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation of PD-L1, because inhibition of either mTORC1 or p70S6K facilitated β-TrCP degradation accompanied with enhanced PD-L1 protein stabilization. Our current findings indicate the complexity of the mTOR axis in cancer, which should be considered when targeting this axis for effective cancer treatment. Our findings also suggest a strong scientific rationale for enhancing PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy through co-targeting mTORC1/p70S6K signaling.","2019-08","2021-09-14 06:07:28","2021-09-14 06:07:31","2021-09-14 06:07:30","6270-6282","","35","38","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 35 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour immunology Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-immunology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/K7SGNPBL/Deng et al. - 2019 - Inhibition of mTOR complex 1p70 S6 kinase signali.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R3ZA8SHW/s41388-019-0877-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6V8TR9W8/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition.

Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.","2013-07-30","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","12661-12666","","31","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 23842089","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XE8FZ5F6/Völkers et al. - 2013 - Pathological hypertrophy amelioration by PRAS40-me.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P2E7ZRTE/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.","2016-08","2021-09-14 06:21:58","2021-09-14 06:22:03","2021-09-14 06:21:58","4518-4528","","34","35","","","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 34 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Bladder cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;bladder-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X36V87I3/King et al. - 2016 - Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies syn.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/T8X5PHIU/onc2015511.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify the mechanism by which Src overexpression sustains this resistance, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines either sensitive or resistant to lapatinib. Methods: To determine the role of Src in lapatinib resistance, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition/silencing in vitro on survival, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. In vivo experiments were performed in JIMT-1 lapatinib-resistant cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice. We used artificial metastasis assays to evaluate the effect of Src inhibition on the invasiveness of lapatinib-resistant cells. Src-dependent signal transduction was investigated with Western blot and ELISA analyses. Results: Src activation was higher in lapatinib-resistant than in lapatinib-sensitive cells. The selective small-molecule Src inhibitor saracatinib combined with lapatinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. Saracatinib combined with lapatinib significantly prolonged survival of JIMT-1-xenografted mice compared with saracatinib alone, and impaired the formation of lung metastases. Unexpectedly, in lapatinib-resistant cells, Src preferentially interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rather than with HER2. Moreover, EGFR targeting and lapatinib synergistically inhibited survival, migration, and invasion of resistant cells, thereby counteracting Src-mediated resistance. These findings demonstrate that Src activation in lapatinib-resistant cells depends on EGFRdependent rather than on HER2-dependent signaling. Conclusions: Complete pharmacologic EGFR/HER2 inhibition is required to reverse Src-dependent resistance to lapatinib in breast cancer.","2014-06","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","R45","","3","16","","Breast Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D7D5JJ2J/Formisano et al. - 2014 - Epidermal growth factor-receptor activation modula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rapamycin inhibited S6 phosphorylation and cell proliferation, and resulted in lower levels of apoptosis induction. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and S6, synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis with a higher efficacy.

However, the role of MLN4924 in induction of autophagy and its biological significance are totally unknown. Here we showed that MLN4924 effectively induces autophagy in both time- and dose-dependent manners in multiple human cancer lines, indicating a general phenomenon. Mechanistically, by inactivating CRLs, MLN4924 causes accumulation of DEPTOR and HIF1α. The siRNA knockdown and gene KO studies showed that DEPTOR and the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis are responsible for MLN4924-induced autophagy via inhibiting mTORC1. Biologically, autophagy is a survival signal to tumor cells, and blockage of autophagy via siRNA knockdown, gene KO and small molecule inhibitor remarkably enhanced MLN4924-induced apoptosis.

There is no effective therapy for patients with metastatic UM. Improved treatments of hepatic metastatic patients with UM were urgently needed. Inspired by readily detectable key components in the neddylation pathway in UM cells, we aimed at exploring whether neddylation pathway was a therapeutic target for liver metastatic UM. Experimental Design: Expression of key proteins in the neddylation pathway in UM was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemical staining. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) properties were examined upon treatment with MLN4924, a potent and selective NAE inhibitor. Antitumor activity and frequency of CSCs were determined by using a NOD-SCID mouse xenograft model. Liver metastasis was evaluated by use of a NOD-scid-IL2Rg−/− mouse model. Results: NAE1 expression was readily detectable in UM. Inhibition of the neddylation pathway by MLN4924 repressed the CSCs properties in UM (capacities of tumorsphere formation and serially replating, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive cells, and frequency of CSC) through Slug protein degradation. MLN4924 treatment disturbed the paracrine secretion of NF-κB-mediated VEGF-C and its dependent angiogenesis. The inhibitory effect of neddylation blockade on proliferation, which was confirmed by xenografted UM tumor in NOD-SCID mice, was involved in activation of ATM-Chk1-Cdc25C DNA damage response, and G2–M phase arrest. Neddylation inhibition profoundly inhibited hepatic metastasis in UM.

Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with various types of cancer including glioma. Here, we show that high level expression of NDRG1 in tumors significantly correlated with better prognosis of patients with GBM. Loss of NDRG1 in GBM cells upregulated GSK3β levels and promoted cell proliferation, which was reversed by selective inhibitors of GSK3β. In contrast, NDRG1 overexpression suppressed growth of GBM cells by decreasing GSK3β levels via proteasomal degradation and by suppressing AKT and S6 cell growth signaling, as well as cell-cycle signaling pathways. Conversely, GSK3β phosphorylated serine and threonine sites in the C-terminal domain of NDRG1 and limited the protein stability of NDRG1. Furthermore, treatment with differentiation inducing factor-1, a small molecule derived from Dictyostelium discoideum, enhanced NDRG1 expression, decreased GSK3β expression, and exerted marked NDRG1-dependent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which NDRG1 inhibits GBM proliferation and progression. Our study thus identifies the NDRG1/GSK3β signaling pathway as a key growth regulatory program in GBM, and suggests enhancing NDRG1 expression in GBM as a potent strategy toward the development of anti-GBM therapeutics.

However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1−XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1−XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-κB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.","2018-07-24","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","1-16","","8","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LB5TWTM/Jeong et al. - 2018 - XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IV83MPKV/s41419-018-0867-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MLN4924 therefore inhibits also the βTrCP-dependent activation of the classical and the alternative NFĸB pathway. In this work, we found that a subgroup of multiple myeloma cell lines (e.g., RPMI-8226, MM.1S, KMS-12BM) and about half of the primary myeloma samples tested are sensitized to TNF-induced cell death by MLN4924. This correlated with MLN4924-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced activation of the classical NFκB pathway and reduced the efficacy of TNF-induced TNFR1 signaling complex formation. Interestingly, binding studies revealed a straightforward correlation between cell surface TNFR1 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines and their sensitivity for MLN4924/TNF-induced cell death. The cell surface expression levels of TNFR1 in the investigated MM cell lines largely correlated with TNFR1 mRNA expression. This suggests that the variable levels of cell surface expression of TNFR1 in myeloma cell lines are decisive for TNF/MLN4924 sensitivity. Indeed, introduction of TNFR1 into TNFR1-negative TNF/MLN4924-resistant KMS-11BM cells, was sufficient to sensitize this cell line for TNF/MLN4924-induced cell death. Thus, MLN4924 might be especially effective in myeloma patients with TNFR1+ myeloma cells and a TNFhigh tumor microenvironment.","2019-08-13","2021-09-14 06:42:55","2021-09-14 06:42:59","2021-09-14 06:42:55","1-15","","8","10","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour-necrosis factors Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-necrosis-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KJNMMU3R/El-Mesery et al. - 2019 - The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 sens.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular mechanisms involved in the responses to RITA remain enigmatic. Several groups reported the induction of a p53-dependent DNA damage response. Furthermore, the existence of a p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint has been suggested, involving the checkpoint kinase Chk1. We have recently shown synergistic induction of apoptosis by RITA in combination with Nutlin-3, and we observed concomitant Chk2 phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated whether Chk2 contributes to the cellular responses to RITA. Strikingly, the induction of apoptosis seemed entirely Chk2 dependent. Transcriptional activity of p53 in response to RITA required the presence of Chk2. A partial rescue of apoptosis observed in Noxa knockdown cells emphasized the relevance of p53 transcriptional activity for RITA-induced apoptosis. In addition, we observed an early p53- and Chk2-dependent block of DNA replication upon RITA treatment. Replicating cells seemed more prone to entering RITA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the RITA-induced DNA damage response, which was not a secondary effect of apoptosis induction, was strongly attenuated in cells lacking p53 or Chk2. In conclusion, we identified Chk2 as an essential mediator of the cellular responses to RITA.","2012-06","2021-09-14 06:46:06","2021-09-14 06:46:08","2021-09-14 06:46:06","980-989","","6","19","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IM5NVWNK/de Lange et al. - 2012 - Chk2 mediates RITA-induced apoptosis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas arginine activates mTORC1, it is overridden by high expression of cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1). Because cancer cells often encounter low levels of nutrients, an alternative mechanism might exist to regulate CASTOR1 expression. Here we show K29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of CASTOR1 by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF167. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylates CASTOR1 at S14, significantly increasing its binding to RNF167, and hence its ubiquitination and degradation, while simultaneously decreasing its affinity to MIOS, leading to mTORC1 activation. Therefore, AKT activates mTORC1 through both TSC2- and CASTOR1-dependent pathways. Several cell types with high CASTOR1 expression are insensitive to arginine regulation. Significantly, AKT and RNF167-mediated CASTOR1 degradation activates mTORC1 independent of arginine and promotes breast cancer progression. These results illustrate a mTORC1 regulating mechanism and identify RNF167 as a therapeutic target for mTORC1-dysregulated diseases.","2021-02-16","2021-09-14 06:48:33","2021-09-14 06:48:36","2021-09-14 06:48:33","1055","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer metabolism Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-metabolism","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TVJZP948/Li et al. - 2021 - RNF167 activates mTORC1 and promotes tumorigenesis.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7W47DN2V/s41467-021-21206-3.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 α-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNFα-induced neurotoxicity. Opposite to the Alzheimer Disease transgenic mice, the PDK1 knock-in mice exhibited an age-dependent attenuation of the unfolding protein response, which protected the mutant neurons against endoplasmic reticulum stressors.

A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone.

Consequently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the EGFR are among the most effective therapies for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Clinical responses to the EGFR-targeting TKIs are evaluated through 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>FDG)-PET uptake, which is decreased in patients responding favorably to therapy and is positively correlated with survival. Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for glycolysis stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib's anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling. These results support the potential clinical utility of using PFKFB3 inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs to manage NSCLC.</p>","2019-07-05","2021-09-14 07:36:13","2021-09-14 07:36:15","2021-09-14 07:36:13","10530-10543","","27","294","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 31126985","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/24BZKJ3G/Lypova et al. - 2019 - Increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-2,6-bi.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I7HJG8EK/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether AMPK activation itself is sufficient to block cancer cell growth remains to be determined. A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone. This study thus provides a rationale for their combined use in CRPC treatment.","2014-04-01","2021-09-14 07:46:07","2021-09-14 07:46:07","2021-09-14 07:46:07","519-538","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-embopress-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YXRDL8EG/2014 - A novel direct activator of AMPK inhibits prostate.pdf","","","prostate cancer; AMPK direct activation; androgen signaling inhibitors; de novo lipogenesis; MT 63–78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have reported previously that TGF-β1 induces the selective up-regulation of mitochondrial Nox4, playing critical roles in podocyte apoptosis. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Nox4 up-regulation by mTORC1 activation on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in immortalized podocytes. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Blocking TGF-β receptor I with SB431542 completely blunted the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. Transient adenoviral overexpression of mTOR-WT and constitutively active mTORΔ augmented TGF-β1-treated Nox4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis, whereas mTOR kinase-dead suppressed the above changes. In addition, knockdown of mTOR mimicked the effect of mTOR-KD. Inhibition of mTORC1 by low-dose rapamycin or knockdown of p70S6K protected podocytes through attenuation of Nox4 expression and subsequent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by TGF-β1. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade, but not the PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway, abolished TGF-β1-induced mTOR activation. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 or mTORC1 did not reduce the TGF-β1-stimulated increase in Nox4 mRNA level but significantly inhibited total Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, double knockdown of Smad2 and 3 or only Smad4 completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2-mTORactivation. Our data suggest that TGF-β1 increases translation of Nox4 through the Smad-ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis, which is independent of transcriptional regulation. Activation of this pathway plays a crucial role in ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to podocyte apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic and preventive target in proteinuric and chronic kidney diseases.</p>","2015-12-25","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","30830-30842","","52","290","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IL954EFQ/Das et al. - 2015 - Transforming Growth Factor β1-induced Apoptosis in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We showed that SCFβ-TRCP specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-TRCP depletion in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-TRCP1 knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet.

Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

Mechanistically, we identified ATXN3 as a Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal localization is blocked by active Rag heterodimer in response to amino acid stimulation. Consistently, cells lacking functional Rag heterodimer on the lysosome accumulate Ub-Rheb, and blockade of its degradation instigates robust lysosomal mTORC1 localization and its activation without the Ragulator-Rag system. Thus, polyubiquitination of Rheb is an important post-translational modification, which facilitates the binding of mTORC1 to Rheb on the lysosome and is another crosstalk between the amino acid and growth factor signaling for mTORC1 activation.","2020-11-05","2021-09-23 20:30:47","2021-09-23 20:30:47","2021-09-23 20:30:46","437-451.e6","","3","80","","Molecular Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DURHYY56/S1097276520306870.html","","","amino acids; ATXN3; deubiquitination; lysosome; mTORC1; Rag; Ragulator; Rheb; ubiquitin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that the acetylation of the C-terminal region (CTR) of S6K1 blocks mTORC1-dependent Thr-389 phosphorylation, an essential phosphorylation site for S6K1 activity. The acetylation of the CTR of S6K1 is inhibited by the class III histone deacetylases, SIRT1 and SIRT2. An S6K1 mutant lacking acetylation sites in its CTR shows enhanced Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity, whereas the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant exhibits decreased Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity. Interestingly, relative to the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant, the acetylation-defective mutant displays higher affinity toward Raptor, an essential scaffolding component of mTORC1 that recruits mTORC1 substrates.

USP9x inhibited the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TIF1γ from binding and monoubiquitinating SMAD4, hence maintaining the SMAD4 nuclear retention.

Here we assessed mLST8 loss in a panel of normal and cancer cells and observed little to no impact on assembly or activity of mTORC1. However, mLST8 loss blocked mTOR association with mTORC2 cofactors RICTOR and SIN1, thus abrogating mTORC2 activity. Similarly, a single pair of mutations on mLST8 with a corresponding mutation on mTOR interfered with mTORC2 assembly and activity without affecting mTORC1. We also discovered a direct interaction between mLST8 and the NH2-terminal domain of the mTORC2 cofactor SIN1. In PTEN-null prostate cancer xenografts, mLST8 mutations disrupting the mTOR interaction motif inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation and decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the scaffolding function of mLST8 is critical for assembly and activity of mTORC2, but not mTORC1, an observation that could enable therapeutic mTORC2-selective inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.

TNBC frequently harbors alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, but single agent PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have not shown marked efficacy. In this study, we investigated a strategy to improve efficacy of PI3K-α inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) in TNBC. While BYL719 is effective at inhibiting cell proliferation in T47D, a triple positive cell line, it had limited activity in TNBC. This may be partially due to persistent phosphorylation of RB, and incomplete inhibition of p-S6 in TNBC, since the inhibitory effect of BYL719 on p-RB and p-S6 was significantly reduced in TNBC compared to T47D cells. Addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 to BYL719 caused a simultaneous reduction of p-RB and p-S6, and a more complete inhibition of p-S6, leading to decreased expression of the pro-survival protein MCL-1, an induction of apoptosis, and an enhanced reduction of tumor growth in a PDX model of TNBC. These findings suggest that inhibition of p-RB and p-S6 is important for an effective response to the treatment of TNBC, and provides a strong rationale for clinical development of combination therapy with BYL719 and LEE011 for treatment of metastatic TNBC with intact RB.","2019-05-17","2021-09-23 21:01:23","2021-09-23 21:01:23","2021-09-23 21:01:23","7509","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/NBZBA6PF/Yuan et al. - 2019 - Combination therapy with BYL719 and LEE011 is syne.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PXRSIENE/s41598-019-43429-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we show that NF-κB is activated by the two most common PI3K mutations, PIK3CA E545K and H1047R. We found that markers of NF-κB are most strongly upregulated under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Gene expression analysis conducted on cells deprived of growth factors identified the repertoire of genes altered by oncogenic PI3K mutations following growth factor deprivation. This gene set most closely correlated with gene signatures from claudin-low and basal-like breast tumors, subtypes frequently exhibiting constitutive PI3K/Akt activity. An NF-κB–dependent subset of genes driven by oncogenic PI3K mutations was also identified that encoded primarily secreted proteins, suggesting a paracrine role for this gene set. Interestingly, while NF-κB activated by oncogenes such as Ras and EGF receptor leads to cell-autonomous effects, abrogating NF-κB in PI3K-transformed cells did not decrease proliferation or induce apoptosis. However, conditioned media from PI3K mutant-expressing cells led to increased STAT3 activation in recipient THP-1 monocytes or normal epithelial cells in a NF-κB and interleukin-6–dependent manner. Together, our findings describe a PI3K-driven, NF-κB–dependent transcriptional profile that may play a critical role in promoting a microenvironment amenable to tumor progression. These data also indicate that NF-κB plays diverse roles downstream from different oncogenic signaling pathways.

Experience with other successful targeted agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may reduce the durability of clinical benefit. Here, we sought to understand mechanisms underlying resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient cancers. We generated cell lines resistant to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 from parental PTEN-null breast cancer cell lines and identified a novel PIK3CB D1067Y mutation in both cell lines that was recurrent in cancer patients. Stable expression of mutant PIK3CB variants conferred resistance to PI3K inhibition that could be overcome by downstream AKT or mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that the p110β D1067Y mutant was highly activated and induced PIP3 levels at the cell membrane, subsequently promoting the localization and activation of AKT and PDK1 at the membrane and driving PI3K signaling to a level that could withstand treatment with proximal inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the PIK3CB D1067Y mutant behaved as an oncogene and transformed normal cells, an activity that was enhanced by PTEN depletion. Collectively, these novel preclinical and clinical findings implicate the acquisition of activating PIK3CB D1067 mutations as an important event underlying the resistance of cancer cells to selective PI3K inhibitors.

Surprisingly, AMPK is also activated by growth factor EGF through Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinase and is essential for EGF-mediated Akt activation and biological functions. AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes.

The biochemical data are intrinsically stochastic and tend to be observed by means of discrete-time sampling systems, which are often limited in their completeness. In this paper we explore how to make Bayesian inference for the kinetic rate constants of regulatory networks, using the stochastic kinetic Lotka-Volterra system as a model. This simple model describes behaviour typical of many biochemical networks which exhibit auto-regulatory behaviour. Various MCMC algorithms are described and their performance evaluated in several data-poor scenarios. An algorithm based on an approximating process is shown to be particularly efﬁcient.","2008-06","2019-01-31 03:16:52","2019-01-31 03:16:53","2019-01-31 03:16:52","125-135","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HIGFHY3B/Boys et al. - 2008 - Bayesian inference for a discretely observed stoch.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latter is a Monte-Carlo method, which, despite enjoying broad availability in a large number of existing software packages, is computationally expensive due to the huge amounts of ensemble averaging required for obtaining accurate statistical information. The former is a set of coupled differential-difference equations for the probability of the system being in any one of the possible mesoscopic states; these equations are typically computationally intractable because of the inherently large state space. Here we introduce the software package intrinsic Noise Analyzer (iNA), which allows for systematic analysis of stochastic biochemical kinetics by means of van Kampen’s system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation. iNA is platform independent and supports the popular SBML format natively. The present implementation is the first to adopt a complementary approach that combines state-of-the-art analysis tools using the computer algebra system Ginac with traditional methods of stochastic simulation. iNA integrates two approximation methods based on the system size expansion, the Linear Noise Approximation and effective mesoscopic rate equations, which to-date have not been available to non-expert users, into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. In particular, the present methods allow for quick approximate analysis of timedependent mean concentrations, variances, covariances and correlations coefficients, which typically outperforms stochastic simulations. These analytical tools are complemented by automated multi-core stochastic simulations with direct statistical evaluation and visualization. We showcase iNA’s performance by using it to explore the stochastic properties of cooperative and non-cooperative enzyme kinetics and a gene network associated with circadian rhythms. The software iNA is freely available as executable binaries for Linux, MacOSX and Microsoft Windows, as well as the full source code under an open source license.","2012-06-12","2019-01-31 03:18:30","2019-01-31 03:18:30","2019-01-31 03:18:30","e38518","","6","7","","","Intrinsic Noise Analyzer","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X29BZDNG/Thomas et al. - 2012 - Intrinsic Noise Analyzer A Software Package for t.pdf","","","","Peccoud, Jean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more easily digestible for some audiences.","2010-04-24","2019-01-31 03:18:42","2019-01-31 03:18:42","2019-01-31 03:18:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1004.4280","<p>Comment: 6 pages, no figures</p>","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7CFNY8IA/Wallace - 2010 - A simplified derivation of the Linear Noise Approx.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WZIXLTMQ/1004.html","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Compared to the FBA model, the logical model has information on an additional 263 putative genes and 247 additional reactions. The correctness of this model was evaluated by comparison with iND750 (an updated FBA model closely related to iFF708) by evaluating the performance of both models on predicting empirical minimal medium growth data/essential gene listings.

However, most reports of scientific results in the published literature make it difficult for the reader to reproduce the statistical analyses performed in achieving those results because they provide inadequate documentation of the statistical tests and algorithms applied. The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is put forward here as a step towards solving this problem. Results The terms in OBCS including ‘data collection’, ‘data transformation in statistics’, ‘data visualization’, ‘statistical data analysis’, and ‘drawing a conclusion based on data’, cover the major types of statistical processes used in basic biological research and clinical outcome studies. OBCS is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and extends the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), an OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry ontology supported by over 20 research communities. Currently, OBCS comprehends 878 terms, representing 20 BFO classes, 403 OBI classes, 229 OBCS specific classes, and 122 classes imported from ten other OBO ontologies., We discuss two examples illustrating how the ontology is being applied. In the first (biological) use case, we describe how OBCS was applied to represent the high throughput microarray data analysis of immunological transcriptional profiles in human subjects vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. In the second (clinical outcomes) use case, we applied OBCS to represent the processing of electronic health care data to determine the associations between hospital staffing levels and patient mortality. Our case studies were designed to show how OBCS can be used for the consistent representation of statistical analysis pipelines under two different research paradigms. Other ongoing projects using OBCS for statistical data processing are also discussed., The OBCS source code and documentation are available at: https://github.com/obcs/obcs. Conclusions The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is a community-based open source ontology in the domain of biological and clinical statistics. OBCS is a timely ontology that represents statistics-related terms and their relations in a rigorous fashion, facilitates standard data analysis and integration, and supports reproducible biological and clinical research.","2016-09-14","2019-02-01 21:05:12","2019-02-01 21:05:12","2019-02-01 21:05:12","","","","7","","J Biomed Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27627881 PMCID: PMC5024438","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DH5342KS/Zheng et al. - 2016 - The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024438/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After all, the untold number of interactions of tens of thousands of genes, a greater number of their products and product derivatives, and tens of thousands of chemicals came much closer to complete characterization. Paradoxically however, while individual efforts produced important biological results, an integrated view of biology from systems perspective seemed ever more distant due to the complexity of data integration from multiple knowledge representation forms, formalisms, modeling paradigms, and conﬂicting scientiﬁc statements. To address this, semantic technologies have risen over the past decade with the promise of truly unifying biological knowledge and allowing cross-domain queries and model integration. In this chapter, we shall examine Semantic Web technologies and their applications to build, publish, query, discover, compare, validate, reason about, and evaluate models and knowledge in Systems Biology. We shall speciﬁcally address biological ontologies, open data repositories, modeling and annotation tools, and selected promising applications of Semantic Systems Biology. We ﬁrmly believe that it shall soon be possible to completely close the gap between facts, models, and results, and to fully apply the accrued models and facts to evaluate biological hypotheses on a system level, discovering meaning within the vast collection of biological knowledge and taking Systems Biology research to a new, unprecedented level.","2013","2019-02-04 02:20:23","2019-02-04 02:20:23","2019-02-04 02:20:23","355-373","","","","","","Semantic Systems Biology","","","","","Springer Netherlands","Dordrecht","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-6803-1_12","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AKF96QYN/Dumontier et al. - 2013 - Semantic Systems Biology Formal Knowledge Represe.pdf","","","","Prokop, Aleš; Csukás, Béla","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a pressing technological need for the better representation of biomedical protocols to enable other agents (human or machine) to better reproduce results. A framework that ensures that all information required for the replication of experimental protocols is essential to achieve reproducibility. Methods We have developed the ontology EXACT2 (EXperimental ACTions) that is designed to capture the full semantics of biomedical protocols required for their reproducibility., To construct EXACT2 we manually inspected hundreds of published and commercial biomedical protocols from several areas of biomedicine. After establishing a clear pattern for extracting the required information we utilized text-mining tools to translate the protocols into a machine amenable format. We have verified the utility of EXACT2 through the successful processing of previously 'unseen' (not used for the construction of EXACT2) protocols. Results The paper reports on a fundamentally new version EXACT2 that supports the semantically-defined representation of biomedical protocols. The ability of EXACT2 to capture the semantics of biomedical procedures was verified through a text mining use case. In this EXACT2 is used as a reference model for text mining tools to identify terms pertinent to experimental actions, and their properties, in biomedical protocols expressed in natural language. An EXACT2-based framework for the translation of biomedical protocols to a machine amenable format is proposed. Conclusions The EXACT2 ontology is sufficient to record, in a machine processable form, the essential information about biomedical protocols. EXACT2 defines explicit semantics of experimental actions, and can be used by various computer applications. It can serve as a reference model for for the translation of biomedical protocols in natural language into a semantically-defined format.","2014-11-27","2019-02-04 21:15:24","2019-02-04 21:15:24","2019-02-04 21:15:24","S5","","Suppl 14","15","","BMC Bioinformatics","EXACT2","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25472549 PMCID: PMC4255744","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U9HFFBJ6/Soldatova et al. - 2014 - EXACT2 the semantics of biomedical protocols.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255744/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.","2016-02-03","2019-02-09 17:07:15","2019-02-09 17:07:25","2019-02-09 17:07:15","e10047","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eLife","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TJF9JY5F/Naik et al. - 2016 - Active machine learning-driven experimentation to .pdf","","","active learning; automation of research; high content screening; laboratory automation; machine learning; protein subcellular location","Ohler, Uwe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The critical temperature range of -10° to -30O was unrelated to the temperatures at which the suspending fluids completely solidified, these temperatures being -0.3°, -11°, -30°, and -71° for the four liquids, respectively. Survival at -30° or below was greatly affected by the rate at which the cells were cooled or warmed, with higher survivals being obtained with slow cooling and with rapid warming. Length of exposure at -30° was not a factor; injury was inflicted within 1 minute. The results are interpreted as indicating that death is a result of intracellular ice formation.

"HYP2KP5B","journalArticle","","Rackauckas, Chris","An Intuitive Introduction For Understanding and Solving Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations","","","","","","Stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) are a generalization of deterministic diﬀerential equations that incorporate a “noise term”. These equations can be useful in many applications where we assume that there are deterministic changes combined with noisy ﬂuctuations. Ito’s Calculus is the mathematics for handling such equations. In this article we introduce stochastic diﬀerential equations and Ito’s calculus from an intuitive point of view, building the ideas from relatable probability theory and only straying into measure-theoretic probability (deﬁning all concepts along the way) as necessary. All of the proofs are discussed intuitively and rigorously: step by step proofs are provided. . We start by reviewing the relevant probability needed in order to develop the stochastic processes. We then develop the mathematics of stochastic processes in order to deﬁne the Poisson Counter Process. We then deﬁne Brownian Motion, or the Wiener Process, as a limit of the Poisson Counter Process. By doing the deﬁnition in this manner, we are able to solve for many of the major properties and theorems of the stochastic calculus without resorting to measure-theoretic approaches. Along the way, examples are given to show how the calculus is actually used to solve problems. After developing Ito’s calculus for solving SDEs, we brieﬂy discuss how these SDEs can be computationally simulated in case the analytical solutions are diﬃcult or impossible. After this, we turn to deﬁning some relevant terms in measure-theoretic probability in order to develop ideas such as conditional expectation and martingales. The conclusion to this article is a set of four applications. We show how the rules of the stochastic calculus and some basic martingale theory can be applied to solve problems such as option pricing, genetic drift, stochastic control, and stochastic ﬁltering. The end of this article is a cheat sheet that details the fundamental rules for “doing” Ito’s calculus, like one would ﬁnd on the cover ﬂap of a calculus book. These are the equations/properties/rules that one rules to solve stochastic diﬀerential equations that are explained and justiﬁed in the article but put together for convenience.","","2019-03-13 02:54:29","2019-03-13 02:54:29","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q7TS6A5K/Rackauckas - An Intuitive Introduction For Understanding and So.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although Schwann cells (SCs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are the main cell source for nerve tissue engineering, the clinical application is limited because of donor site morbidity, the invasive procedure, and the decreased number of SCs and BM-MSCs. Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) could be a promising cell source for nerve tissue engineering because they are easily accessible and their use has no ethical issues. We investigated the phenotypic, molecular and functional characteristics of WJMSCs differentiated along a Schwann-cell lineage. Cultured WJMSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord, and the undifferentiated WJMSCs were conﬁrmed by the detection of MSC-speciﬁc cell-surface markers. WJMSCs treated with a mixture of glial growth factors (basic ﬁbroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and forskolin) adopted a spindle-like morphology similar to SCs. Immunocytochemical staining, RT-PCR analysis, and Western blot analysis revealed that the treated cells expressed the glial markers glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein, p75, S100 and P0 and indicative of differentiation. On co-culture with dorsal root ganglia neurons, the differentiated WJMSCs enhanced the number of sprouting neurites and neurite length in dorsal root ganglia neurons. Furthermore, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and RT-PCR methodology, we found differentiated WJMSCs secrete and express neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). Quantiﬁcation of neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells grown in differentiated WJMSCs-conditioned media demonstrates that the neurite length is significantly more than control medium and undifferentiated WJMSCs group. WJMSCs can be differentiated into cells that are Schwann-like in terms of morphologic features, phenotype, and function and could be suitable Schwann-cell substitutes for nerve repair in clinical applications.","2011-02","2019-03-14 05:57:40","2019-03-14 05:57:40","2019-03-14 05:57:40","235-243","","3","84","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/INQ2XCNT/Peng et al. - 2011 - Human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although adult, their differentiation potential is remarkable, and they are able to transdifferentiate. Transdifferentiated cultivated rat MSC (tMSC) changed morphologically into cells resembling typical spindle-shaped Schwann cells (SC) with enhanced expression of LNGF receptor, Krox-20, CD104 and S100b protein and decreased expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor-1A compared to untreated rat MSC (rMSC). Transdifferentiation was reversible and repeatable. To evaluate the myelinating capacity, rMSC, tMSC, or SC cultured from male rats were grafted into an autologous muscle conduit bridging a 2-cm gap in the female rat sciatic nerve. The presence of the male-speciﬁc SRY gene (as revealed by PCR analysis) and S100 immunoreactivity of pre-labeled tMSC conﬁrmed the presence of the implanted cells in the grafts.

To potentiate their possible trophic effect, hMSCs were induced without genetic modification to adopt characteristics of Schwann cells (SCs), which provide trophic support for regenerating axons. The induced hMSCs (shMSCs) adopted a SC-like morphology and expressed SC-specific proteins including the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which correlated with cell-cycle exit. In addition, shMSCs secreted higher amounts of several growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) when compared with uninduced hMSCs. Coculture of shMSCs with Neuro2A cells significantly increased neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation but decreased cell death. Transplantation of shMSCs in an ex vivo model of spinal cord injury dramatically enhanced axonal outgrowth, which was mediated by HGF and VEGF secretion and also decreased cell death. These results demonstrate that shMSCs could serve as an endogenous source of neurotrophic growth factors to facilitate axonal regeneration while at the same time protecting the resident cells at the site of tissue injury.

Autologous SC transplantation has been performed and has shown promising clinical results for treating nerve injuries and donor site morbidity, and insufficient production of the cells have been considered as a major issue. Here, we performed differentiation of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) into SC-like cells (T-MSC-SCs), to evaluate T-MSC-SCs as an alternative to SCs. Using SC markers such as CAD19, GFAP, MBP, NGFR, S100B, and KROX20 during quantitative real-time PCR we detected the upregulation of NGFR, S100B, and KROX20 and the downregulation of CAD19 and MBP at the fully differentiated stage. Furthermore, we found myelination of axons when differentiated SCs were cocultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. The application of T-MSC-SCs to a mouse model of sciatic nerve injury produced marked improvements in gait and promoted regeneration of damaged nerves. Thus, the transplantation of human T-MSCs might be suitable for assisting in peripheral nerve regeneration.","2016-11","2019-03-14 06:08:57","2019-03-14 06:08:57","2019-03-14 06:08:57","1867","","11","17","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PPSU8LLT/Jung et al. - 2016 - Tonsil-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Differentiat.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Y6Y3JNJE/1867.html","","","differentiation; peripheral nerve; regeneration; Schwann cell; tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although co-culture with Schwann cells or chemicals combined with a mixture of glial growth factors are often utilized for Schwann cell-like differentiation of ADSCs, these methods are usually complicated or expensive. In this experiment, the rat sciatic nerve was cut, and then soaked in culture medium for two days. The treated culture medium was used as an induction agent after ﬁltering. The obtained ADSCs were incubated with the above induction culture medium for ﬁve days. Then, expression of the typical Schwann cell markers, S-100 and GFAP proteins was determined by immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting. The results showed that almost all of the treated ADSCs displayed a spindle shape like morphology after being incubated with induction culture medium for 24 h and expressed S-100 and GFAP proteins after ﬁve days.

To assess this potential, we compared HUCPVCs to the “gold standard” bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) with respect to their proliferation, differentiation, and transfection capacities. HUCPVCs showed a higher proliferative potential than BMSCs and were capable of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation. Interestingly, osteogenic differentiation of HUCPVCs proceeded more rapidly than BMSCs. Additionally, HUCPVCs expressed higher levels of CD146, a putative MSC marker, relative to BMSCs. HUCPVCs showed comparable transfection efficiency as BMSCs using a nucleofection method but were more amenable to transfection with liposomal methods (FuGENE). Gene array analysis showed that HUCPVCs also expressed Wnt signaling pathway genes that have been implicated in the regulation of MSCs.

However, there is increasing benefit to formalizing the descriptions of protocols, as laboratory automation systems (such as microfluidic chips) are becoming increasingly capable of executing them. Our goal in this paper is to improve both the reproducibility and automation of biology experiments by using a programming language to express the precise series of steps taken. Results We have developed BioCoder, a C++ library that enables biologists to express the exact steps needed to execute a protocol. In addition to being suitable for automation, BioCoder converts the code into a readable, English-language description for use by biologists. We have implemented over 65 protocols in BioCoder; the most complex of these was successfully executed by a biologist in the laboratory using BioCoder as the only reference. We argue that BioCoder exposes and resolves ambiguities in existing protocols, and could provide the software foundations for future automation platforms. BioCoder is freely available for download at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/india/projects/biocoder/. Conclusions BioCoder represents the first practical programming system for standardizing and automating biology protocols. Our vision is to change the way that experimental methods are communicated: rather than publishing a written account of the protocols used, researchers will simply publish the code. Our experience suggests that this practice is tractable and offers many benefits. We invite other researchers to leverage BioCoder to improve the precision and completeness of their protocols, and also to adapt and extend BioCoder to new domains.","2010-11-08","2019-03-26 04:50:42","2019-03-26 04:50:42","2019-03-26 04:50:42","13","","","4","","J Biol Eng","Biocoder","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 21059251 PMCID: PMC2989930","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5EQC9H3X/Ananthanarayanan and Thies - 2010 - Biocoder A programming language for standardizing.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989930/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects.

However, research tasks that are not highly standardized are still rarely automated in practice. Two main reasons for this are the substantial investments required to translate molecular biological protocols into robot programs, and the fact that the resulting programs are often too speciﬁc to be easily reused and shared. Recent developments of standardized protocols and dedicated programming languages for liquid-handling operations addressed some aspects of ease-of-use and portability of protocols. However, either they focus on simplicity, at the expense of enabling complex protocols, or they entail detailed programming, with corresponding skills and eﬀorts required from the users. To reconcile these trade-oﬀs, we developed Roboliq, a software system that uses artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods to integrate (i) generic formal, yet intuitive, protocol descriptions, (ii) complete, but usually hidden, programming capabilities, and (iii) user-system interactions to automatically generate executable, optimized robot programs. Roboliq also enables high-level speciﬁcations of complex tasks with conditional execution. To demonstrate the system’s beneﬁts for experiments that are diﬃcult to perform manually because of their complexity, duration, or time-critical nature, we present three proof-of-principle applications for the reproducible, quantitative characterization of GFP variants.","2018-03-16","2019-09-24 04:15:18","2019-09-24 04:15:18","2019-09-24 04:15:18","922-932","","3","7","","ACS Synth.

Despite recent experimental advances, the estimation of unknown parameter values from observed data is still a bottleneck for obtaining accurate simulation results. Many methods exist for parameter estimation in deterministic biochemical systems; methods for discrete stochastic systems are less well developed. Given the probabilistic nature of stochastic biochemical models, a natural approach is to choose parameter values that maximize the probability of the observed data with respect to the unknown parameters, a.k.a. the maximum likelihood parameter estimates (MLEs). MLE computation for all but the simplest models requires the simulation of many system trajectories that are consistent with experimental data. For models with unknown parameters, this presents a computational challenge, as the generation of consistent trajectories can be an extremely rare occurrence. Results: We have developed Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization with Modiﬁed Cross-Entropy Method (MCEM2): an accelerated method for calculating MLEs that combines advances in rare event simulation with a computationally eﬃcient version of the Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Our method requires no prior knowledge regarding parameter values, and it automatically provides a multivariate parameter uncertainty estimate. We applied the method to ﬁve stochastic systems of increasing complexity, progressing from an analytically tractable pure-birth model to a computationally demanding model of yeast-polarization. Our results demonstrate that MCEM2 substantially accelerates MLE computation on all tested models when compared to a stand-alone version of MCEM. Additionally, we show how our method identiﬁes parameter values for certain classes of models more accurately than two recently proposed computationally eﬃcient methods. Conclusions: This work provides a novel, accelerated version of a likelihood-based parameter estimation method that can be readily applied to stochastic biochemical systems. In addition, our results suggest opportunities for added eﬃciency improvements that will further enhance our ability to mechanistically simulate biological processes.","2012","2019-09-26 17:48:14","2019-09-26 17:48:14","2019-09-26 17:48:14","68","","1","13","","BMC Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/84YUMZN3/Daigle et al. - 2012 - Accelerated maximum likelihood parameter estimatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate.","2012-03-05","2019-11-06 03:11:49","2019-11-06 03:11:49","2019-11-06 03:11:49","","","","6","","Front Comput Neurosci","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22403538 PMCID: PMC3293145","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BB939E5T/Hartshorne and Schachner - 2012 - Tracking Replicability as a Method of Post-Publica.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293145/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During recent years there was accepted that algebraic techniques, in particular different kinds of image algebras, is the most prospective direction of construction of the mathematical theory of image analysis and of development an universal algebraic language for representing image analysis transforms and image models. So, the main goal of the Algebraic Approach is designing of a unified scheme for representation of objects under recognition and its transforms in the form of certain algebraic structures. It makes possible to develop corresponding regular structures ready for analysis by algebraic, geometrical and topological techniques. Development of this line of image analysis and pattern recognition is of crucial importance for automated image mining and application problems solving, in particular for diversification classes and types of solvable problems and for essential increasing of solution efficiency and quality.","2016","2019-11-12 21:28:59","2019-11-12 21:28:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CL6NNDPH/Gurevich et al. - 2016 - The Algebraic and Descriptive Approaches and Techn.pdf; ","https://api.semanticscholar.org/6180f9b73e7718e50692bc02d13c7634db2f50b6","","Physical object; Science; Academy; Algorithm; Body Dysmorphic Disorders; cell transformation; Class; Cybernetics; Decision problem; Description; Diversification (finance); HL7PublishingSubSection <operations>; Image analysis; Image processing; Linear algebra; Linguistics; Mathematical morphology; Mathematics; Operand; Pattern recognition; Pattern theory; Prospective search; Requirement; Signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The constructed model involves two-compartment kinetics of the activators IkB (IKK) and NF-kB; the inhibitors A20 and IkBa; and their complexes. In resting cells, the unphosphorylated IkBa binds to NF-kB and sequesters it in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. In response to extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, IKK is transformed from its neutral form (IKKn) into its active form (IKKa), a form capable of phosphorylating IkBa; leading to IkBa degradation. Degradation of IkBa releases the main activator NF-kB; which then enters the nucleus and triggers transcription of the inhibitors and numerous other genes. The newly synthesized IkBa leads NF-kB out of the nucleus and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits IKK converting IKKa into the inactive form (IKKi), a form different from IKKn, no longer capable of phosphorylating IkBa: After parameter ﬁtting, the proposed model is able to properly reproduce time behavior of all variables for which the data are available: NF-kB; cytoplasmic IkBa; A20 and IkBa mRNA transcripts, IKK and IKK catalytic activity in both wild-type and A20-deﬁcient cells. The model allows detailed analysis of kinetics of the involved proteins and their complexes and gives the predictions of the possible responses of whole kinetics to the change in the level of a given activator or inhibitor.","2004-05","2019-12-02 03:51:57","2019-12-02 03:51:58","2019-12-02 03:51:57","195-215","","2","228","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/LFAPNI5E/Lipniacki et al. - 2004 - Mathematical model of NF-κB regulatory module.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following muscle damage, myoblasts proliferate and differentiate in response to temporally-varying inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix cues, which stimulate a shared network of intracellular signaling pathways. Here we present an integrated data-modeling approach to elucidate synergies and antagonisms among proliferation and differentiation signaling axes in myoblasts stimulated by regeneration-associated ligands.MethodsWe treated mouse primary myoblasts in culture with combinations of eight regeneration-associated growth factors and cytokines in mixtures that induced additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects on myoblast proliferation and differentiation responses. For these combinatorial stimuli, we measured the activation dynamics of seven signal transduction pathways using multiplexed phosphoprotein assays and scored proliferation and differentiation responses based on expression of myogenic commitment factors to assemble a cue-signaling-response data compendium. We interrogated the relationship between these signals and responses by partial least-squares (PLS) regression modeling.ResultsPartial least-squares data-modeling accurately predicted response outcomes in cross-validation on the training compendium (cumulative R 2 = 0.96). The PLS model highlighted signaling axes that distinctly govern myoblast proliferation (MEK–ERK, Stat3) and differentiation (JNK) in response to these combinatorial cues, and we confirmed these signal-response associations with small molecule perturbations. Unexpectedly, we observed that a negative feedback circuit involving the phosphatase DUSP6/MKP-3 auto-regulates MEK–ERK signaling in myoblasts.ConclusionThis data-modeling approach identified conflicting signaling axes that underlie muscle progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.","2017-10-01","2019-12-03 05:11:38","2019-12-03 05:11:38","2019-12-03 05:11:38","433-450","","5","10","","Cel.

Quantitative measurements of cell-cycle dynamics in single cells showed that despite variability in G1-, S-, and G2 phases, duration of mitosis is short and remarkably constant. Surprisingly, there is no correlation between cell-cycle length and mitotic duration, suggesting that mitosis is temporally insulated from variability in earlier cell-cycle phases. By combining live cell imaging and computational modeling, we showed that positive feedback is the molecular mechanism underlying the temporal insulation of mitosis. Perturbing positive feedback gave rise to a sluggish, variable entry and progression through mitosis and uncoupled duration of mitosis from variability in cell cycle length. We show that positive feedback is important to keep mitosis short, constant, and temporally insulated and anticipate it might be a commonly used regulatory strategy to create modularity in other biological systems.","2016-10-20","2019-12-03 05:16:56","2019-12-03 05:16:56","2019-12-03 05:16:56","362-375","","2","64","","Molecular Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RIUQWGJ4/Araujo et al. - 2016 - Positive Feedback Keeps Duration of Mitosis Tempor.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FEC55XFB/S1097276516305676.html","","","cell division; mitosis; positive feedback; quantitative biology; temporal control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relative quality of sequencing data and accuracy of genetic variant detection from blood-­derived, saliva-­derived and buccal-d­ erived DNA need to be thoroughly investigated. Methods  Matched blood, saliva and buccal samples from four unrelated individuals were used to compare sequencing metrics and variant-d­ etection accuracy among these DNA sources. Results  We observed significant differences among DNA sources for sequencing quality metrics such as percentage of reads aligned and mean read depth (p<0.05). Differences were negligible in the accuracy of detecting short insertions and deletions; however, the false positive rate for single nucleotide variation detection was slightly higher in some saliva and buccal samples. The sensitivity of copy number variant (CNV) detection was up to 25% higher in blood samples, depending on CNV size and type, and appeared to be worse in saliva and buccal samples with high bacterial concentration. We also show that methylation-b­ ased enrichment for eukaryotic DNA in saliva and buccal samples increased alignment rates but also reduced read-d­ epth uniformity, hampering CNV detection. Conclusion  For WGS, we recommend using DNA extracted from blood rather than saliva or buccal swabs; if saliva or buccal samples are used, we recommend against using methylation-­based eukaryotic DNA enrichment. All data used in this study are available for further open-­science investigation.","2019-12","2019-12-05 16:04:57","2019-12-05 16:04:57","2019-12-05 16:04:57","809-817","","12","56","","J Med Genet","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MMCGEHWI/Trost et al. - 2019 - Impact of DNA source on genetic variant detection .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CD133 has reproducibly been shown to correlate with disease progression, recurrence, and poor overall survivorship in the malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). Using several patient-derived CD133high and CD133low GBMs we describe intrinsic differences in determinants of stemness, which we owe to a CD133-AKT-Wnt signaling axis in which CD133 functions as a putative cell surface receptor for AKTdependent Wnt activation.

To date, work in understanding these proteomic responses through high-throughput imaging has catalogued localization changes independently for each perturbation. To distinguish changes that are targeted responses to the specific perturbation or more generalized programs, we developed a scalable approach to visualize the localization behavior of proteins across multiple experiments as a quantitative pattern. By applying this approach to 24 experimental screens consisting of nearly 400,000 images, we differentiated specific responses from more generalized ones, discovered nuance in the localization behavior of stress-responsive proteins, and formed hypotheses by clustering proteins that have similar patterns. Previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, whereas our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology.           ,              Cells are busy structures in which proteins move from one place to the other to perform their roles. To survive, organisms must constantly adapt to changes, such as mutations, new environments, or encountering drugs. Often, these adaptive responses involve groups of proteins traveling to new locations in the cell. Tracking these movements is useful to understand which biological processes cells activate to cope with modifications.             To study these mechanisms, scientists conduct experiments where they expose cells to one type of change – for example they mutate one gene, or give one drug. They then follow the proteins in the cell using powerful microscopes.             These instruments can take thousands of pictures of cells every day, which results in large amounts of data. The images are then analyzed, which is often subjective, time-consuming or cannot easily be repeated on other experiments. This prevents researchers from considering more than one experiment at the time, and it makes it difficult to compare how cells respond across many different types of changes.             Here, Lu et al. combine and analyze 400,000 images from 24 experiments conducted on yeasts; they use a computational method that automatically measures the differences in the locations of the proteins between experiments. This new large-scale approach reveals aspects of cell biology that are not obvious from the results of any one experiment alone. For example, responses that are specific to one type of change can be distinguished from the ones that occur each time cells are exposed to new conditions. It also becomes possible, for the first time, to group together proteins that move in the same way across different types of changes, and to infer their roles. For instance, a protein was shown to be ‘pulsing’ – moving quickly between two specific compartments in the cell – based on how it shared certain features with other pulsing proteins.             This computational approach is not limited to experiments on yeasts, and could be used on studies in human cells as well. Drug companies could then compare at a large scale how different treatments affect protein localization.","2018-04-05","2019-12-10 04:56:32","2019-12-10 04:56:32","2019-12-10 04:56:32","e31872","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BEUVVLAJ/Lu et al. - 2018 - Integrating images from multiple microscopy screen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate XGA on yeast ABC transporters by engineering 5,353 strains, each deleted for a random subset of 16 transporters, and proﬁling each strain’s resistance to 16 compounds. XGA yielded 85,648 genotype-to-resistance observations, revealing high-order genetic interactions for 13 of the 16 transporters studied.

The identification of any clinically approved drug that could be repurposed to combat COVID-19 would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures to complement social distancing and isolation protocols. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target for drug interventions, based on results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV) an HIV protease inhibitor, that that can inhibit the Mpro of 2002 SARS-CoV. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved anti-retroviral protease inhibitors that may bind more efficiently to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and block its replication. Of high interest is atazanavir (ATV) due to its documented bioavailability within the respiratory tract, which motivated our evaluation on its ability to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication through a series of in vitro experiments. A molecular dynamic analysis showed that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV and occupied the substrate cleft on the active side of the protease throughout the entire molecular dynamic analysis. In a cell-free protease assay, ATV was determined to block Mpro activity at a concentration of 10 μM. Next, a series of assays with in vitro models of virus infection/replications were performed using three cell types, Vero cells, a human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary human monocytes, which confirmed that ATV could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV). In addition, the virus-induced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were reduced in the presence of these drugs, which performed better than chloroquine, a compound recognized for its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.","2020-04-05","2020-04-07 07:21:44","2020-04-07 07:21:44","2020-04-07 07:21:44","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.04.020925","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q3K4ZWBF/Fintelman-Rodrigues et al. - 2020 - Atazanavir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and pro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in assay technology have led to major improvements in how HIV NAbs are measured. Stable cell lines containing HIV Tat-regulated reporter genes are now available that permit rapid, sensitive and reproducible measurements of virus neutralization after a single round of infection in a high throughput format.Moreover, these assays may be used with molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses for greater reagent stability and traceability.A luciferase (Luc) reporter gene assay performed in TZM-bl (JC53bl-13) cells was recently optimized and many of its performance parameters have been validated.

Remarkably, we summarize here the most relevant theoretical and practical aspects that we have learned for more than 20 years developing and using the miniaturized PFGE systems. We also discussed the theoretical aspects related to DNA migration in PFGE agarose gels. It served as the basis for simulating the DNA electrophoretic patterns in CHEF mini gels and mini-chambers during experimental design and optimization.

In lane segmentation, we characterized the structural features and the spatial distribution of bands in PFGE images to fit pairs of parallel lines. In band extraction, a polynomial fitting method was used to remove the uneven background in a lane; we then used local gradient information to split the stuck bands and extract all bands in every lane. We compared the results with existing semiautomatic methods based on 20 varied PFGE images.

We used genetic and biochemical approaches to compare the responses of IAP-deﬁcient mice and cells to NOD2 stimulation. In all cell types tested, XIAP is the only IAP required for signaling immediately downstream of NOD2, while cIAP1 and cIAP2 are dispensable for NOD2-induced nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation.

"MKKGKVQW","journalArticle","","Nakamoto, Satoshi","Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System","","","","","","A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.","","2021-01-11 09:27:59","2021-01-11 09:28:00","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSZHAKWA/Nakamoto - Bitcoin A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The observation that many tumors express EGF receptor (EGFR), yet only a small subset with EGFR-activating mutations respond clinically to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs), suggests that responsive tumors uniquely depend on EGFR signaling for their survival. The nature of this dependence is not understood. Here, we investigate dependence on EGFR signaling by comparing non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines driven by EGFR-activating mutations and genomic amplifications using a global proteomic analysis of phospho-tyrosine signaling. We identify an extensive receptor tyrosine kinase signaling network established in cells expressing mutated and activated EGFR or expressing amplified c-Met. We show that in drug sensitive cells the targeted tyrosine kinase drives other RTKs and an extensive network of downstream signaling that collapse with drug treatment. Comparison of the signaling networks in EGFR and c-Met-dependent cells identify a “core network” of ≈50 proteins that participate in pathways mediating drug response.","2008-01-15","2021-02-10 23:44:14","2021-02-10 23:44:14","2021-02-10 23:44:14","692-697","","2","105","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 18180459","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5Y3U3CKI/Guo et al. - 2008 - Signaling networks assembled by oncogenic EGFR and.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MDL65FWN/692.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180459","","c-Met; EGF receptor; oncogene dependence; proteomics; stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hippo pathway nuclear effectors, Taz/Yap, interact with the TGF-β transcriptional mediators, Smads, to control Smad activity. Key to TGF-β signaling is the nuclear localization of Smads. Thus, to investigate the role of Taz/Yap in Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed mathematical models of Hippo and TGF-β cross talk. The models were based on experimental measurements of TGF-β-induced changes in Taz/Yap and Smad subcellular localization obtained using high-throughput immunofluorescence (IF) imaging in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, EpH4. Bayesian MCMC DREAM parameter estimation was used to quantify the uncertainty in estimates of the kinetic parameters.

Multiple effective drug combinations were identified. For example, the combination of ALK and MEK inhibitors was active in an ALK-positive resistant tumor that had developed a MAP2K1 activating mutation, and the combination of EGFR and FGFR inhibitors was active in an EGFR mutant resistant cancer with a novel mutation in FGFR3. Combined ALK and SRC inhibition was effective in several ALK-driven patient-derived models, a result not predicted by genetic analysis alone.

Signals flow through Mst/Lats kinases, which phosphorylate and promote cytoplasmic localization of the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz to inhibit transcription. Here, we identify the multidomain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef7, or ?Pix, as a positive Hippo pathway regulator. We show that ?Pix, which localizes to the cytoplasm, binds both Lats and Yap/Taz and thereby promotes Lats-mediated phosphorylation of Yap/Taz in a GEF-independent manner. ?Pix is required downstream of both cell density sensing and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, and we demonstrate that loss of ?Pix expression in normal mammary epithelial cells strongly reduces Yap/Taz phosphorylation, promotes nuclear localization and increases target gene expression. Conversely, increased expression of ?PIX in breast cancer cell lines re-couples the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz, promoting localization of Yap/Taz to the cytoplasm and inhibiting cell migration and proliferation. These studies thus define ?Pix as a key component that links the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz in response to multiple upstream Hippo pathway activators.","2014-12-17","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2997-3011","","24","33","","The EMBO Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-embopress-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8XWWVUYA/Heidary Arash et al. - 2014 - Arhgef7 promotes activation of the Hippo pathway c.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R2BB6QI2/embj.html","","","Arhgef7; Hippo; Lats; mechanotransduction; Yap/Taz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting RTK-phosphatase interactome reveals a considerable number of previously unidentified interactions and suggests specific roles for different phosphatase families. Additionally, the differential PPIs of some protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and their mutants suggest diverse mechanisms of these PTPs in the regulation of RTK signaling. We further found that PTPRH and PTPRB directly dephosphorylate EGFR and repress its downstream signaling. By contrast, PTPRA plays a dual role in EGFR signaling: besides facilitating EGFR dephosphorylation, it enhances downstream ERK signaling by activating SRC.

Historically, therapeutics targeting RTKs have been identified using in vitro kinase assays. Due to frequent development of drug resistance, however, there is a need to identify more diverse compounds that inhibit mutated but not wild-type RTKs. Here, we describe MaMTH-DS (mammalian membrane two-hybrid drug screening), a live-cell platform for high-throughput identification of small molecules targeting functional protein–protein interactions of RTKs. We applied MaMTH-DS to an oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant resistant to the latest generation of clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

One of these targets mutant EGFR via a new mechanism of action, distinct from classical TKI inhibition.

Such information is crucial to understanding cellular pathways and developing effective therapies for the treatment of human diseases. Over the past two decades, diverse biochemical, genetic, and cell biological methods have been developed to map interactomes. In this review, we highlight basic principles of interactome mapping. Specifically, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of individual assays, how to select a method appropriate for the problem being studied, and provide general guidelines for carrying out the necessary follow-up analyses. In addition, we discuss computational methods to predict, map, and visualize interactomes, and provide a summary of some of the most important interactome resources. We hope that this review serves as both a useful overview of the field and a guide to help more scientists actively employ these powerful approaches in their research.","2015-12-01","2021-03-15 15:47:27","2021-03-15 15:47:27","2021-03-15 15:47:27","848","","12","11","","Molecular Systems Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-embopress-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2EK49L3M/Snider et al. - 2015 - Fundamentals of protein interaction network mappin.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CBGW6G9N/msb.html","","","proteomics; bioinformatics; interactome mapping; PPI technologies; protein-protein interactions (PPIs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This included designing better methods for the successful delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into mammalian cells. While the simplest method for RNAi is the cytosolic delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides, this technique is limited to cells capable of transfection and is primarily utilized during transient in vitro studies. The introduction of shRNA into mammalian cells through infection with viral vectors allows for stable integration of shRNA and long-term knockdown of the targeted gene; however, several challenges exist with the implementation of this technology. Here we describe some well-tested protocols which should increase the chances of successful design, delivery, and assessment of gene knockdown by shRNA. We provide suggestions for designing shRNA targets and controls, a protocol for sequencing through the secondary structure of the shRNA hairpin structure, and protocols for packaging and delivery of shRNA lentiviral particles. Using real-time PCR and functional assays we demonstrate the successful knockdown of ASC, an inflammatory adaptor molecule. These studies demonstrate the practicality of including two shRNAs with different efficacies of knockdown to provide an additional level of control and to verify dose dependency of functional effects. Along with the methods described here, as new techniques and algorithms are designed in the future, shRNA is likely to include further promising application and continue to be a critical component of gene discovery.","2010","2021-03-17 01:16:48","2021-03-17 01:16:48","2021-03-17 01:16:48","139-156","","","","","","Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)","Methods in Molecular Biology","","","","Humana Press","Totowa, NJ","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-60761-657-3_10","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QBFUGNVN/Taxman et al. - 2010 - Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Design, Delivery, and A.pdf","","","ASC; delivery; design; ELISA; IL-1β; lentivirus; Porphyromonas gingivalis; RNA interference (RNAi); short hairpin RNA (shRNA); small interfering RNA (siRNA); THP1","Sioud, Mouldy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In accordance with the advancement of the technologies for the acquisition of WB signals, a quantitative value is used to present the abundance of target proteins in a complex sample, thereby requiring the use of specific proteins as internal references that represent total proteins. Heretofore, proteins encoded by housekeeping genes such as GAPDH, β-tubulin and β-actin have been commonly used as loading controls without any hesitation because their mRNA expression levels tend to be high and constant in many different cells and tissues. Experimentally, however, some of the housekeeping reference proteins are often displayed with inconsistent expression levels in both homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues, and, in terms of mRNA levels, they have a weak correlation to the abundance of proteins. To estimate accurate, reliable, and reproducible protein quantifications, it is crucial to define appropriate reference controls. For this paper, we explored the recently released large-scale, human proteomic database ProteomicsDB including 16 857 liquid chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry data from 27 human tissues, and suggest 20 ubiquitously- and constitutively-expressed, putative internal-reference controls for the quantification of differential protein expressions. Intriguingly, the most commonly used, known housekeeping genes were entirely excluded in our newly defined candidates. Although the applications of the candidates under many different biological conditions and in other organisms are yet to be empirically verified, we propose reliable, potential loading controls for a WB analysis in this paper.","2016","2021-03-17 20:51:19","2021-03-17 20:51:48","2021-03-17 20:51:19","1863-1867","","13","16","","","State-of-the-art housekeeping proteins for quantitative western blotting","","","","","","","en","© 2016 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A superior method to protein normalization using housekeeping proteins is Total Protein Normalization, a method now recognized as the gold standard for quantitative westerns. Total Protein Normalization requires that all proteins on a membrane be stained or labeled uniformly, imaged, and then analyzed for total protein. It is important that such a normalization process not interfere with typical immunodetection methods, fits within existing western workflows, and exhibits a linear relationship of signal intensity to protein load under all experimental conditions. Here we report that we developed a new reagent enabling Total Protein Normalization, and we demonstrate its superior protein normalization capabilities through analysis of target proteins in different cell backgrounds. These data illustrate how housekeeping proteins exhibit signal saturation, yield erroneous normalization data, and display sample-to-sample variations averaging 48.2 % overall.

For fluorescent WB, however, blockers may bring in additional autofluorescence, and optimal blocking conditions have been less well established. Here, the autofluorescence of Tween 20 is clarified, which is negligible when imaged wet, but could be significant when Tween 20 is dried on blots. In most situations, blocking with Tween 20 reduces background and/or improves specific signals. Systematical investigation of blocking conditions for fluorescent WB reveals that the autofluorescent background is determined by a combination of multiple factors including the blocker, the excitation/emission configuration, the membrane, and the H2O (wet or dry), varying case by case. The commonly used protein or polymer blockers (milk, bovine serum albumin, fish gelatin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone) each have unique advantages and disadvantages concerning the autofluorescence, the blocking efficiency, and the cost. 0.005%–0.02% sodium dodecyl sulphate can be included to reduce non-specific bands and background caused by non-specific binding of antibodies, however, at the cost of also impairing specific signals.

In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces transient ERK activation that leads to cell proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes sustained ERK activation and cell differentiation. These differences have typically been assumed to reflect distinct feedback mechanisms in the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network, with the receptors themselves acting as simple upstream inputs. We failed to confirm the expected differences in feedback type when investigating transient versus sustained signaling downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and NGF receptor (TrkA). Instead, we found that ERK signaling faithfully followed RTK dynamics when receptor signaling was modulated in different ways. EGFR activation kinetics, and consequently ERK signaling dynamics, were switched from transient to sustained when receptor internalization was inhibited with drugs or mutations, or when cells expressed a chimeric receptor likely to have impaired dimerization. In addition, EGFR and ERK signaling both became more sustained when substoichiometric levels of erlotinib were added to reduce duration of EGFR kinase activation. Our results argue that RTK activation kinetics play a crucial role in determining MAP kinase cascade signaling dynamics and cell fate decisions, and that signaling outcome can be modified by activating a given RTK in different ways.","2020-08-18","2021-04-09 05:23:49","2021-04-09 05:23:49","2021-04-09 05:23:48","eaaz5267","","645","13","","Sci.

Here, we identified an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation site that we termed the TOR interaction motif (TIM; F-x               3               -F-pT), which controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of PKC and Akt and the activity of these kinases. The TIM is invariant in mTORC2-dependent AGC kinases, is evolutionarily conserved, and coevolved with mTORC2 components. Mutation of this motif in Akt1 and PKCβII abolished cellular kinase activity by impairing activation loop and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. mTORC2 directly phosphorylated the PKC TIM in vitro, and this phosphorylation event was detected in mouse brain. Overexpression of PDK1 in mTORC2-deficient cells rescued hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC and Akt by a mechanism dependent on their intrinsic catalytic activity, revealing that mTORC2 facilitates the PDK1 phosphorylation step, which, in turn, enables autophosphorylation. Structural analysis revealed that PKC homodimerization is driven by a TIM-containing helix, and biophysical proximity assays showed that newly synthesized, unphosphorylated PKC dimerizes in cells. Furthermore, disruption of the dimer interface by stapled peptides promoted hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which mTORC2 relieves nascent PKC dimerization through TIM phosphorylation, recruiting PDK1 to phosphorylate the activation loop and triggering intramolecular hydrophobic motif autophosphorylation.

In order to emphasize the importance of the visual aspect of scholarly communication, a new ﬁeld called viziometrics is recently proposed. This paper presents an ongoing project for a case study of viziometrics where we focus on western blots within Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) literature. We ﬁrst develop a computer vision method to detect western blots from the images of ﬁgures.

Ubiquitin signaling plays a critical role in coordinating protein recruitment during the DNA damage response. Here, we find that the microRNA biogenesis factor DGCR8 promotes tumor resistance to X-ray radiation independently of its Drosha-binding ability. Upon radiation, the kinase ATM and the deubiquitinase USP51 mediate the activation and stabilization of DGCR8 through phosphorylation and deubiquitination. Specifically, radiation-induced ATM-dependent phosphorylation of DGCR8 at serine 677 facilitates USP51 to bind, deubiquitinate, and stabilize DGCR8, which leads to the recruitment of DGCR8 and DGCR8’s binding partner RNF168 to MDC1 and RNF8 at DSBs. This, in turn, promotes ubiquitination of histone H2A, repair of DSBs, and radioresistance. Altogether, these findings reveal the non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DSB repair and suggest that radiation treatment may result in therapy-induced tumor radioresistance through ATM- and USP51-mediated activation and upregulation of DGCR8.","2021-06-29","2021-07-01 03:15:39","2021-07-02 20:14:09","2021-07-01 03:15:39","4033","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Double-strand DNA breaks;Radiotherapy;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: double-strand-dna-breaks;radiotherapy;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J6GH323Z/Hang et al. - 2021 - Non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DNA double-stra.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DMS96PUV/s41467-021-24298-z.html","","Houston; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these limitations, we designed a series of compounds that selectively inhibit mTORC1 and not mTORC2. These ‘bi-steric inhibitors’ comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. Structural modification of these components modulated their affinities for their binding sites on mTOR and the selectivity of the bi-steric compound. mTORC1-selective compounds potently inhibited 4EBP1 phosphorylation and caused regressions of breast cancer xenografts. Inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation was sufficient to block cancer cell growth and was necessary for maximal antitumor activity. At mTORC1-selective doses, these compounds do not alter glucose tolerance, nor do they relieve AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of HER3. Thus, in preclinical models, selective inhibitors of mTORC1 potently inhibit tumor growth while causing less toxicity and receptor reactivation as compared to pan-mTOR inhibitors.","2021-06-24","2021-07-01 03:17:23","2021-09-07 20:59:20","2021-07-01 03:17:23","1-10","","","","","Nat Chem Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Cell signalling;Kinases;Medicinal chemistry;Small molecules Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;cell-signalling;kinases;medicinal-chemistry;small-molecules","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DQF3EMXY/Lee et al. - 2021 - Selective inhibitors of mTORC1 activate 4EBP1 and .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KRFHQR59/s41589-021-00813-7.html","","Extreme; New York; California; _company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alterations in dosage of DYRK1A leads to defects in neurogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation, and may increase the risk of certain cancers. DYRK1A localizes to a number of subcellular structures including vesicles where it is known to phosphorylate a number of proteins and regulate vesicle biology. However, the mechanism by which it translocates to vesicles is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of TRAF2, an E3 ligase, as an interaction partner of DYRK1A. Our data suggest that TRAF2 binds to PVQE motif residing in between the PEST and histidine repeat domain (HRD) of DYRK1A protein, and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A. This results in translocation of DYRK1A to the vesicle membrane. DYRK1A increases phosphorylation of Sprouty 2 on vesicles, leading to the inhibition of EGFR degradation, and depletion of TRAF2 expression accelerates EGFR degradation. Further, silencing of DYRK1A inhibits the growth of glioma cells mediated by TRAF2. Collectively, these findings suggest that the axis of TRAF2–DYRK1A-Sprouty 2 can be a target for new therapeutic development for EGFR-mediated human pathologies.","2021-06-11","2021-07-01 03:18:39","2021-07-02 22:28:39","2021-07-01 03:18:39","1-13","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer in the nervous system;Kinases;Ubiquitins;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: cancer-in-the-nervous-system;kinases;ubiquitins;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QK5SITL9/Zhang et al. - 2021 - K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A by TRAF2 allev.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EUA2FXBM/s41419-021-03887-2.html","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolutionary conservation of this process and its requirement for maintaining cellular homeostasis emphasizes the need to better dissect the pathways governing its molecular regulation. In our previously performed high-content screen, we assessed the effect of 1530 RNA-binding proteins on autophagy. Among the top regulators, we identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A-3 (eIF4A3). Here we show that depletion of eIF4A3 leads to a potent increase in autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis and an enhanced autophagic flux. This is mediated by the key autophagy transcription factor, TFEB, which becomes dephosphorylated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it elicits an integrated transcriptional response. We further identified an exon-skipping event in the transcript encoding for the direct TFEB kinase, GSK3B, which leads to a reduction in GSK3B expression and activity. Through analysis of TCGA data, we found a significant upregulation of eIF4A3 expression across several cancer types and confirmed the potential relevance of this newly identified signaling axis in human tumors. Hence, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role for eIF4A3 as a gatekeeper of autophagy through the control of TFEB activation, revealing a new mechanism for autophagy regulation.","2021-06-22","2021-07-01 03:25:34","2021-07-01 03:25:34","2021-07-01 03:25:34","1-13","","","","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Macroautophagy;Molecular biology;RNA;RNA-binding proteins Subject_term_id: macroautophagy;molecular-biology;rna;rna-binding-proteins","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/67WSUWDF/Sakellariou et al. - 2021 - eIF4A3 regulates the TFEB-mediated transcriptional.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WCK9PLCU/s41418-021-00822-y.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that CUPs are a distinct, yet unrecognized, pathological entity originating from stem-like cells endowed with peculiar and shared properties. These cells can be isolated in vitro (agnospheres) and propagated in vivo by serial transplantation, displaying high tumorigenicity. After subcutaneous engraftment, agnospheres recapitulate the CUP phenotype, by spontaneously and quickly disseminating, and forming widespread established metastases. Regardless of different genetic backgrounds, agnospheres invariably display cell-autonomous proliferation and self-renewal, mostly relying on unrestrained activation of the MAP kinase/MYC axis, which confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Such sensitivity is associated with a transcriptomic signature predicting that more than 70% of CUP patients could be eligible to MEK inhibition.

Here we employ an unbiased kinome-wide siRNA screen to reveal that HER3, is essential for the proliferation of most HNSCC cells that do not harbor PIK3CA mutations. Indeed, we find that persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 and PI3K recruitment underlies aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in PIK3CA wild type HNSCCs. Remarkably, antibody-mediated HER3 blockade exerts a potent anti-tumor effect by suppressing HER3-PI3K-AKT-mTOR oncogenic signaling and concomitantly reversing the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Ultimately, we show that HER3 inhibition and PD-1 blockade may provide a multimodal precision immunotherapeutic approach for PIK3CA wild type HNSCC, aimed at achieving durable cancer remission.","2021-04-22","2021-07-01 03:29:06","2021-07-01 03:29:06","2021-07-01 03:29:06","2383","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/55Z8F9B5/Wang et al. - 2021 - Disruption of the HER3-PI3K-mTOR oncogenic signali.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PPBZMDQW/s41467-021-22619-w.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we utilize HER2 transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME2) to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo response and recurrence upon T-DM1 treatment. Continuous in vitro dosing of HME2 cells with T-DM1 failed to produce a spontaneously resistant cell line. However, induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via pretreatment with TGF-β1 was capable of promoting emergence of T-DM1-resistant (TDM1R) cells. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that induction of EMT decreased trastuzumab binding, prior to overt loss of HER2 expression in TDM1R cells. Kinome analyses of TDM1R cells indicated increased phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB4, and FGFR1. TDM1R cells failed to respond to the ErbB kinase inhibitors lapatinib and afatinib, but they acquired sensitivity to FIIN4, a covalent FGFR kinase inhibitor. In vivo, minimal residual disease (MRD) remained detectable via bioluminescent imaging following T-DM1-induced tumor regression. Upon cessation of the ADC, relapse occurred and secondary tumors were resistant to additional rounds of T-DM1. These recurrent tumors could be inhibited by FIIN4. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of FGFR1 was sufficient to enhance tumor growth, diminish trastuzumab binding, and promote recurrence following T-DM1-induced MRD. Finally, patient-derived xenografts from a HER2+ breast cancer patient who had progressed on trastuzumab failed to respond to T-DM1, but tumor growth was significantly inhibited by FIIN4.

Cross-validation of the mouse and the human transcriptomic data from the NIH Accelerating Medicines Partnership–AD database demonstrated that pathways improved by the treatment in APP/PS1 mice, including the immune system response and neurotransmission, represent mechanisms essential for therapeutic efficacy in AD patients.","2021-01-08","2021-07-01 03:52:04","2021-07-02 22:24:12","2021-07-01 03:52:04","1-20","","1","4","","Commun Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Alzheimer's disease Subject_term_id: alzheimers-disease","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QLRX2994/Stojakovic et al. - 2021 - Partial inhibition of mitochondrial complex I amel.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WZNIBKVB/s42003-020-01584-y.html","","Medium; Rochester","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sensitive monitoring platform for cancer-associated miRNA (oncomiR) action is needed for mechanistic studies, preclinical evaluation, and inhibitor screening. In this study, we developed and systemically applied a sensitive and efficient lentivirus-based system for monitoring oncomiR actions, essentially miR-21. The specificity and sensitivity of “miRDREL” against various oncomiRs were validated by checking for tight correlations between their expression and targeting efficacy. Experiments based on the transfection of synthetic mimics and antagomir-mediated depletion of oncomiRs further confirmed the specificity of the system. Systemic application of miRDRELs to natural oncomiR targets, knockdown of key microprocessors, and physiological triggering of oncomiRs also demonstrated that the system is an effective tool for monitoring cellular oncomiR action. Importantly, molecular modeling-based screening confirmed the action of the miR-21-targeting drug ivermectin and led to the identification of a new effective derivative, GW4064, for inhibiting oncogenic DDX23-miR-21 signaling. Furthermore, proteomic-kinase inhibitor screenings identified a novel oncogenic kinome-DDX23-miR-21 axis and thus expands our understanding of miR-21 targeting therapeutics in tumorigenesis. Taken together, these data indicate that miRDREL and its versatile application have great potential in basic, preclinical studies and drug development pipelines for miRNA-related diseases, especially cancer.","2020-12","2021-07-01 03:53:38","2021-07-02 19:22:42","2021-07-01 03:53:38","1989-2004","","12","52","","Exp Mol Med","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 12 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Oncogenes Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;oncogenes","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BGYL4FEI/Seo et al. - 2020 - Development of a miRNA-controlled dual-sensing sys.pdf","","Low","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanically, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AL354740.1-204 (also named as NUDT3-AS4) acts as a microRNA sponge to compete with AKT1/mTOR mRNAs for binding to miR-99s, leading to decrease in degradation of AKT1/mTOR mRNAs and subsequent increase in AKT1/mTOR protein expression. Inhibition of lncRNA-NUDT3-AS4 and suppression of the NUDT3-AS4/miR-99s association contribute to Comp34-affected biologic pathways. In addition, Comp34 alone is effective in cells with secondary resistance to rapamycin, the best-known inhibitor of mTOR, and displays a greater in vivo antitumor efficacy and lower toxicity than rapamycin in TNBC xenografted models.

While enhancing CHIP functionality has broad therapeutic potential, prior efforts have all relied on genetic upregulation. Here we report that CHIP-mediated protein turnover is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation at S20 (mouse, S19 human). This increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein half-life, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. PKG-mediated CHIP-pS20 or expressing CHIP-S20E (phosphomimetic) reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A amplifies both. In vivo, depressing PKG activity lowers CHIP-S20 phosphorylation and protein, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been canonically used in NSCLC treatment. However, prevalent innate and acquired resistances and EGFR kinase-independent pro-survival properties limit the clinical efficacy of EGFR TKIs. Therefore, the discovery of novel EGFR degraders is a promising approach towards improving therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. Here, we identified a 23-hydroxybetulinic acid derivative, namely DPBA, as a novel EGFR small-molecule ligand. It exerted potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in both EGFR wild type and mutant NSCLC by degrading EGFR. Mechanistic studies disclosed that DPBA binds to the EGFR extracellular domain at sites differing from those of EGF and EGFR. DPBA did not induce EGFR dimerization, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, but it significantly promoted EGFR degradation and repressed downstream survival pathways. Further analyses showed that DPBA induced clathrin-independent EGFR endocytosis mediated by flotillin-dependent lipid rafts and unaffected by EGFR TKIs. Activation of the early and late endosome markers rab5 and rab7 but not the recycling endosome marker rab11 was involved in DPBA-induced EGFR lysosomal degradation. The present study offers a new EGFR ligand for EGFR pharmacological degradation and proposes it as a potential treatment for EGFR-positive NSCLC, particularly NSCLC with innate or acquired EGFR TKI resistance. DPBA can also serve as a chemical probe in the studies on EGFR trafficking and degradation.","2020-10-09","2021-07-01 04:01:11","2021-07-02 19:59:18","2021-07-01 04:01:11","1-13","","1","5","","Sig Transduct Target Ther","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Drug development;Lung cancer Subject_term_id: drug-development;lung-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UAJSCJLV/Yao et al. - 2020 - Discovery of a novel EGFR ligand DPBA that degrade.pdf","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The serine-13 residue of Lyn (Lyn-S13) was shown to be N-myristoylation-dependently phosphorylated. Although there have been more than 40 reports of mass spectrometric studies on phosphorylation at Lyn-S13, the kinase responsible remained unclear. We succeeded in identifying casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells co-expressing Lyn and CK1γ, the phosphorylation level of Lyn-S13 increased significantly. CK1γ is unique among the CK1 family (α, γ, δ, and ε) in carrying an S-palmitoylation site for membrane binding. Co-expression with the non-S-palmitoylated CK1γ mutant, which localized in the cytosol, gave no increase in the phosphorylation level at Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells expressing the non-S-palmitoylated Lyn-C3A mutant, on the other hand, the Lyn-C3A mutant was phosphorylated at Lyn-S13, and the mutant remained at the Golgi.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding.

Using these structural insights, we developed PHI1, a BRAF inhibitor that fully uncovers the allosteric site. PHI1 exhibits discrete cellular selectivity for BRAF dimers, with enhanced inhibition of the second protomer when the first protomer is occupied, comprising a novel class of dimer selective inhibitors.

Here, anticancer activity and mechanism of action was investigated for the first time using a human prostate cancer (PCa) model. MomC was active in all PCa cell lines at low micromolar concentrations and induced an unusual caspase-independent, non-apoptotic cell death. Kinase activity screening identified activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK1/2) to be one of the primary molecular mechanism of MomC anticancer activity. Functional assays demonstrated a specific and selective JNK1/2 activation prior to the induction of other cell death related processes. Inhibition of JNK1/2 by pretreatment with the JNK-inhibitor SP600125 antagonized cytotoxic activity of the marine compound. MomC caused an upregulation of cytotoxic ROS. However, in contrast to other ROS-inducing agents, co-treatment with PARP-inhibitor olaparib revealed antagonistic effects indicating an active PARP to be necessary for MomC activity. Interestingly, although no direct regulation of p38 and ERK1/2 were detected, active p38 kinase was required for MomC efficacy, while the inhibition of ERK1/2 increased its cytotoxicity. In conclusion, MomC shows promising activity against PCa, which is exerted via JNK1/2 activation and non-apoptotic cell death.","2020-08-06","2021-07-01 04:04:06","2021-07-02 22:24:47","2021-07-01 04:04:06","13178","","1","10","","Sci Rep","Marine alkaloid monanchoxymycalin C","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Marine biology;Marine chemistry Subject_term_id: marine-biology;marine-chemistry","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UGMY3RPW/Dyshlovoy et al. - 2020 - Marine alkaloid monanchoxymycalin C a new specifi.pdf","","Germany; Low","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leveraging the temporal and acute control offered by our strategy, we show that FES activity is dispensable for differentiation of HL-60 cells towards macrophages.

The induction of senescence may represent a strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when combined with a second drug that selectively eliminates senescent cancer cells (senolysis)4,5. Here, using a kinome-focused genetic screen, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-replication kinase CDC7 induces senescence selectively in liver cancer cells with mutations in TP53. A follow-up chemical screen identified the antidepressant sertraline as an agent that kills hepatocellular carcinoma cells that have been rendered senescent by inhibition of CDC7. Sertraline suppressed mTOR signalling, and selective drugs that target this pathway were highly effective in causing the apoptotic cell death of hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with a CDC7 inhibitor. The feedback reactivation of mTOR signalling after its inhibition6 is blocked in cells that have been treated with a CDC7 inhibitor, which leads to the sustained inhibition of mTOR and cell death. Using multiple in vivo mouse models of liver cancer, we show that treatment with combined inhibition of of CDC7 and mTOR results in a marked reduction of tumour growth.

Upregulation of SPAK-dependent CCC phosphorylation has been implicated in several neurological diseases. Using a scaffold-hybrid strategy, we develop a novel potent and selective SPAK inhibitor, 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (“ZT-1a”). ZT-1a inhibits NKCC1 and stimulates KCCs by decreasing their SPAK-dependent phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a decreases inflammation-induced CCC phosphorylation in the choroid plexus and reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion in a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a reduces ischemia-induced CCC phosphorylation, attenuates cerebral edema, protects against brain damage, and improves outcomes in a model of stroke.

Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the survival of 336 GBM patients, demonstrating that under standard treatment, which includes TMZ, EGFRvIII expression is associated with prolonged survival, but only in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumors. Using isogenic GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII expression we could demonstrate that EGFRvIII increases TMZ sensitivity and results in enhanced numbers of DNA double-strand breaks and a pronounced S/G2-phase arrest after TMZ treatment. We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII.

NF2-associated VSs are often accompanied by meningioma (MN), and the majority of NF2 patients show loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor. mTORC1 and mTORC2-specific serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) are constitutively activated in MN with loss of NF2.

Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of combination therapy with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. For these reasons, we investigated activated mTORC1/2 and EPH receptor-mediated signaling in sporadic and NF2-associated VS. Using primary human VS cells and a mouse allograft model of schwannoma, we evaluated the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib as monotherapies and in combination. Escalating dose-response experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 µM). In vivo, while AZD2014 and dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy exceeds that of either drug. Co-targeting the mTOR and EPH receptor pathways with these or similar compounds may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for VS, a condition for which there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.","2020-03-06","2021-07-01 04:13:19","2021-07-02 19:26:07","2021-07-01 04:13:19","4211","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Pharmacology;Tumour-suppressor proteins Subject_term_id: pharmacology;tumour-suppressor-proteins","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/796A23XJ/Sagers et al. - 2020 - Combination therapy with mTOR kinase inhibitor and.pdf","","Medium; Boston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of ‘classical’ oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M–checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN.

Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment.","2020-05","2021-07-01 04:17:08","2021-07-02 19:53:21","2021-07-01 04:17:08","3939-3951","","19","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 19 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer immunotherapy;Prostate cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-immunotherapy;prostate-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9BJLG6SC/Liu et al. - 2020 - p300CBP inhibition enhances the efficacy of progr.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HSRTAID7/s41388-020-1270-z.html","","High; Kentucky","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 causes Phelan-McDermid syndrome and autism, whereas duplication of the same gene leads to SHANK3 duplication syndrome, a disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric phenotypes including hyperactivity and bipolar disorder as well as epilepsy. We recently demonstrated the functional modularity of Shank3, which suggests that normalizing levels of Shank3 itself might be more fruitful than correcting pathways that function downstream of it for treatment of disorders caused by alterations in SHANK3 dosage. To identify upstream regulators of Shank3 abundance, we performed a kinome-wide siRNA screen and identified multiple kinases that potentially regulate Shank3 protein stability. Interestingly, we discovered that several kinases in the MEK/ERK2 pathway destabilize Shank3 and that genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of ERK2 increases Shank3 abundance in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that ERK2 binds Shank3 and phosphorylates it at three residues to promote its poly-ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Altogether, our findings uncover a druggable pathway as a potential therapeutic target for disorders with reduced SHANK3 dosage, provide a rich resource for studying Shank3 regulation, and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for identifying regulators of dosage-sensitive genes.","2020-10","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2021-07-02 19:01:45","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2504-2516","","10","25","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","en","2019 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 10 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Autism spectrum disorders;Biotechnology;Genetics Subject_term_id: autism-spectrum-disorders;biotechnology;genetics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4BL2SRTC/Wang et al. - 2020 - A kinome-wide RNAi screen identifies ERK2 as a dru.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4Y5AW72W/s41380-018-0325-9.html","","Medium; Houston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, its amino-terminal region binds FLASH, an RDH-specific 3′-end processing factor, which keeps the kinase on the chromatin. CDK11 phosphorylates serine 2 (Ser2) of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is initiated when RNAPII reaches the middle of RDH genes and is required for further RNAPII elongation and 3′-end processing. CDK11 depletion leads to decreased number of cells in S phase, likely owing to the function of CDK11 in RDH gene expression.

However, there is no available selective CDK2 inhibitor. More importantly, the inhibition of only the enzymatic function of CDK2 would be insufficient to promote notable AML differentiation. To further validate the role and druggability of CDK2 involved in AML differentiation, a suitable chemical tool is needed. Therefore, we developed first-in-class CDK2-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which promoted rapid and potent CDK2 degradation in different cell lines without comparable degradation of other targets, and induced remarkable differentiation of AML cell lines and primary patient cells.

Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of VCP ATPase activity, we show that VCP stabilizes Beclin-1 levels by promoting the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 towards Beclin-1. VCP also regulates the assembly and activity of the Beclin-1-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex I, thus regulating the production of PI(3)P, a key signaling lipid responsible for the recruitment of downstream autophagy factors. A decreased level of VCP, or inhibition of its ATPase activity, impairs starvation-induced production of PI(3)P and limits downstream recruitment of WIPI2, ATG16L and LC3, thereby decreasing autophagosome formation, illustrating an important role for VCP in early autophagy initiation.","2021-04","2021-07-01 04:32:03","2021-07-02 19:52:19","2021-07-01 04:32:03","448-455","","4","17","","Nat Chem Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Kinases;Membrane trafficking;Small molecules Subject_term_id: cell-death;kinases;membrane-trafficking;small-molecules","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/564GYEJR/Hill et al. - 2021 - VCPp97 regulates Beclin-1-dependent autophagy ini.pdf","","High; UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DYRK1A localizes to a number of subcellular structures including vesicles where it is known to phosphorylate a number of proteins and regulate vesicle biology. However, the mechanism by which it translocates to vesicles is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of TRAF2, an E3 ligase, as an interaction partner of DYRK1A. Our data suggest that TRAF2 binds to PVQE motif residing in between the PEST and histidine repeat domain (HRD) of DYRK1A protein, and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A. This results in translocation of DYRK1A to the vesicle membrane. DYRK1A increases phosphorylation of Sprouty 2 on vesicles, leading to the inhibition of EGFR degradation, and depletion of TRAF2 expression accelerates EGFR degradation. Further, silencing of DYRK1A inhibits the growth of glioma cells mediated by TRAF2. Collectively, these findings suggest that the axis of TRAF2–DYRK1A-Sprouty 2 can be a target for new therapeutic development for EGFR-mediated human pathologies.","2021-06-11","2021-07-01 04:32:15","2021-07-01 04:32:15","2021-07-01 04:32:15","1-13","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer in the nervous system;Kinases;Ubiquitins;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: cancer-in-the-nervous-system;kinases;ubiquitins;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FK8VN3Z2/Zhang et al. - 2021 - K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A by TRAF2 allev.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction with Cyclin A and associated factors is identified as a signature of β-herpesvirus kinases. Cyclin A is recruited via RXL motifs that overlap with nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the non-catalytic N termini. This architecture is conserved in HHV6, HHV7 and rodent cytomegaloviruses. Cyclin A binding competes with NLS function, enabling dynamic changes in CHPK localization and substrate phosphorylation. The cytomegalovirus kinase M97 sequesters Cyclin A in the cytosol, which is essential for viral inhibition of cellular replication.

Using a nuclear targeted Akt Substrate-based Tandem Occupancy Peptide Sponge (Akt-STOPS) that we developed for specific inhibition of Akt, a critical upstream kinase, we show that growth factor-stimulated nuclear mTORC1 activity requires nuclear Akt activity. Further mechanistic dissection suggests that nuclear Akt activity mediates growth factor-induced nuclear translocation of Raptor, a regulatory scaffolding component in mTORC1, and localization of Raptor to the nucleus results in nuclear mTORC1 activity in the absence of growth factor stimulation.

We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates.

Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes.

Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding. Our results reveal the plasticity of an interface pocket within MEK sub-complexes and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs that target the RAS pathway.","2020-12","2021-07-01 04:37:53","2021-07-01 04:37:53","2021-07-01 04:37:53","509-514","","7838","588","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7838 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Chemical biology;Drug development;Kinases;X-ray crystallography Subject_term_id: cancer;chemical-biology;drug-development;kinases;x-ray-crystallography","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TQ2EVJ52/Khan et al. - 2020 - Structural basis for the action of the drug tramet.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shortened mitosis causes tumorigenic aneuploidy, but it is unclear whether it also activates the apoptotic machinery2. Separase, a cysteine protease and trigger of all eukaryotic anaphases, has a caspase-like catalytic domain but has not previously been associated with cell death3,4. Here we show that human cells that enter mitosis with already active separase rapidly undergo death in mitosis owing to direct cleavage of anti-apoptotic MCL1 and BCL-XL by separase. Cleavage not only prevents MCL1 and BCL-XL from sequestering pro-apoptotic BAK, but also converts them into active promoters of death in mitosis. Our data strongly suggest that the deadliest cleavage fragment, the C-terminal half of MCL1, forms BAK/BAX-like pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. MCL1 and BCL-XL are turned into separase substrates only upon phosphorylation by NEK2A. Early mitotic degradation of this kinase is therefore crucial for preventing apoptosis upon scheduled activation of separase in metaphase. Speeding up mitosis by abrogation of the spindle assembly checkpoint results in a temporal overlap of the enzymatic activities of NEK2A and separase and consequently in cell death. We propose that NEK2A and separase jointly check on spindle assembly checkpoint integrity and eliminate cells that are prone to chromosome missegregation owing to accelerated progression through early mitosis.","2020-04","2021-07-01 04:38:58","2021-07-02 19:43:07","2021-07-01 04:38:58","542-547","","7804","580","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7804 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Checkpoints;Kinases;Mitosis;Proteases Subject_term_id: apoptosis;checkpoints;kinases;mitosis;proteases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YHJRRCMG/Hellmuth and Stemmann - 2020 - Separase-triggered apoptosis enforces minimal leng.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QPYN9QKL/s41586-020-2187-y.html","","Germany; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leveraging the temporal and acute control offered by our strategy, we show that FES activity is dispensable for differentiation of HL-60 cells towards macrophages.

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1).

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues.

On the other hand, systemic SHOC2 ablation in adult mice is relatively well tolerated. Furthermore, we show that SHOC2 deletion selectively sensitizes KRAS- and EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, SHOC2 deletion prevents MEKi-induced RAF dimerization, leading to more potent and durable ERK pathway suppression that promotes BIM-dependent apoptosis.

Here we characterize a new selective ROS1/NTRK inhibitor, DS-6051b, in preclinical models of ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancers. DS-6051b induces dramatic growth inhibition of both wild type and G2032R mutant ROS1–rearranged cancers or NTRK-rearranged cancers in vitro and in vivo. Here we report that DS-6051b is effective in treating ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancer in preclinical models, including crizotinib-resistant ROS1 positive cancer with secondary kinase domain mutations especially G2032R mutation which is highly resistant to crizotinib as well as lorlatinib and entrectinib, next generation ROS1 inhibitors.","2019-08-09","2021-07-01 05:30:46","2021-09-07 20:55:00","2021-07-01 05:30:46","3604","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Drug development;Non-small-cell lung cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;drug-development;non-small-cell-lung-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Z9KJ4GQ8/Katayama et al. - 2019 - The new-generation selective ROS1NTRK inhibitor D.pdf","","Japan; Extreme; _company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The MRAS-SHOC2-PP1 (SHOC2 phosphatase) complex plays a key role in RAF-ERK pathway activation by dephosphorylating a critical inhibitory site on RAF kinases. Here we show that genetic inhibition of SHOC2 suppresses tumorigenic growth in a subset of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines and prominently inhibits tumour development in autochthonous murine KRAS-driven lung cancer models. On the other hand, systemic SHOC2 ablation in adult mice is relatively well tolerated. Furthermore, we show that SHOC2 deletion selectively sensitizes KRAS- and EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, SHOC2 deletion prevents MEKi-induced RAF dimerization, leading to more potent and durable ERK pathway suppression that promotes BIM-dependent apoptosis.

STRIPAK also serves as a master regulator for the STE20 family kinases. Following serum or lysophosphatidic acid stimulation, active RhoA binds and dissociates rhophilin and NF2/Kibra from STRIPAK, thereby inducing the association and dephosphorylation of MST1/2 and MAP4Ks by the STRIPAK phosphatase catalytic subunit PP2AC.

We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo. BI-78D3 does not covalently modify p38MAPK, JNK or ERK5. BI-78D3 promotes apoptosis in BRAF inhibitor-naive and resistant melanoma cells containing a BRAF V600E mutation.

In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2).

Binding to a proline-tyrosine motif in the Akt-PH domain, SAV1 suppresses Akt activation by blocking Akt’s movement to plasma membrane. We further identify cancer-associated SAV1 mutations with impaired ability to bind Akt, leading to Akt hyperactivation. We also determine that MERTK phosphorylates Akt1-Y26, releasing SAV1 binding and allowing Akt responsiveness to canonical PI-3K pathway activation.

Mechanistic studies reveal that the increased cytotoxic activity correlates with an increase in AML-NK cell conjugates. GSK3 inhibition promotes the conjugate formation by upregulating LFA expression on NK cells and by inducing ICAM-1 expression on AML cells. The latter is mediated by increased NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α production by NK cells. Finally, GSK3-inhibited NK cells show significant efficacy in human AML mouse models.

Genetic loss of the Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in ULK1 that disrupt the binding of Cu reduced ULK1/2-dependent signalling and the formation of autophagosome complexes. Increased levels of intracellular Cu are associated with starvation-induced autophagy and are sufficient to enhance ULK1 kinase activity and, in turn, autophagic flux.

In GCBC, BCR signals are constrained, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here we describe a GC-specific, AKT-kinase-driven negative feedback loop that attenuates BCR signaling. Mass spectrometry revealed that AKT target activity was altered in GCBCs compared with naive B cells. Retargeting was linked to differential AKT T308 and S473 phosphorylation, in turn controlled by GC-specific upregulation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 and the phosphatase PTEN. In GCBCs, AKT preferentially targeted CSK, SHP-1 and HPK1, which are negative regulators of BCR signaling. We found that phosphorylation enhances enzymatic activity of these proteins, creating a negative feedback loop that dampens upstream BCR signaling. AKT inhibition relieved this negative feedback and enhanced activation of BCR-proximal kinase LYN, as well as downstream BCR signaling molecules in GCBCs.","2019-06","2021-07-01 05:42:30","2021-07-02 22:36:48","2021-07-01 05:42:30","736-746","","6","20","","Nat Immunol","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Germinal centres;Kinases;Phosphorylation;Signal transduction Subject_term_id: germinal-centres;kinases;phosphorylation;signal-transduction","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RGC5ESN2/Luo et al. - 2019 - The AKT kinase signaling network is rewired by PTE.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VD7SZYL7/s41590-019-0376-3.html","","Medium; Pittsburgh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMPK is implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, including autophagy. However, the precise mechanisms by which AMPK controls these processes and the identities of relevant substrates are not fully understood. Using protein microarrays, we identify Cyclin Y as an AMPK substrate that is phosphorylated at Serine 326 (S326) both in vitro and in cells. Phosphorylation of Cyclin Y at S326 promotes its interaction with the Cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), thereby stimulating its catalytic activity. When expressed in cells, Cyclin Y/CDK16 is sufficient to promote autophagy. Moreover, Cyclin Y/CDK16 is necessary for efficient AMPK-dependent activation of autophagy. This functional interaction is mediated by AMPK phosphorylating S326 of Cyclin Y.

Timely dephosphorylation of 53BP1 is critical for genome integrity, as premature recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA lesions impairs mitotic fidelity. Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) dephosphorylates 53BP1 in late mitosis to allow its recruitment to DNA lesions in G1. How cells appropriately dephosphorylate 53BP1, thereby restoring DDR, is unclear. Here, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of kinetic control of 53BP1 dephosphorylation in mitosis. We demonstrate that CDK5, a kinase primarily functional in post-mitotic neurons, is active in late mitotic phases in non-neuronal cells and directly phosphorylates PP4R3β, the PP4 regulatory subunit that recognizes 53BP1. Specific inhibition of CDK5 in mitosis abrogates PP4R3β phosphorylation and abolishes its recognition and dephosphorylation of 53BP1, ultimately preventing the localization of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin.

SREBPs are inhibited by a complex composed of INSIG proteins, SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and sterols in the endoplasmic reticulum. Regulation of the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP by sterol levels is critical for the dissociation of the SCAP–SREBP complex from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of SREBPs1,2. However, whether this protein interaction is regulated by a mechanism other than the abundance of sterol—and in particular, whether oncogenic signalling has a role—is unclear. Here we show that activated AKT in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells phosphorylates cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, at Ser90. Phosphorylated PCK1 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it uses GTP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151. This phosphorylation reduces the binding of sterols to INSIG1 and INSIG2 and disrupts the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP, leading to the translocation of the SCAP–SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus, the activation of SREBP proteins (SREBP1 or SREBP2) and the transcription of downstream lipogenesis-related genes, proliferation of tumour cells, and tumorigenesis in mice. In addition, phosphorylation of PCK1 at Ser90, INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151 is not only positively correlated with the nuclear accumulation of SREBP1 in samples from patients with HCC, but also associated with poor HCC prognosis. Our findings highlight the importance of the protein kinase activity of PCK1 in the activation of SREBPs, lipogenesis and the development of HCC.","2020-04","2021-07-01 05:46:03","2021-09-07 21:00:48","2021-07-01 05:46:03","530-535","","7804","580","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7804 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Kinases Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;kinases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KUFDG5SM/Xu et al. - 2020 - The gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1 phosphorylates INSIG.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/SDQNW2BY/s41586-020-2183-2.html","","China; Most Ever; _company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block.

Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of livers from RagAGTP mice reveal a failed metabolic adaptation to fasting due to a global impairment in PPARα transcriptional program. These metabolic defects are partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and revert by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1.

Functionally, FBXW2 overexpression inhibits migration and invasion by blocking transactivation of MMPs driven by β-catenin, whereas FXBW2 knockdown promotes migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. In human lung cancer specimens, while FBXW2 levels are inversely correlated with β-catenin levels and lymph-node metastasis, lower FBXW2 coupled with higher β-catenin, predict a worse patient survival. Collectively, our study demonstrates that FBXW2 inhibits tumor migration, invasion and metastasis in lung cancer cells by targeting β-catenin for degradation.","2019-03-27","2021-07-01 05:50:12","2021-07-02 22:09:41","2021-07-01 05:50:12","1382","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Non-small-cell lung cancer Subject_term_id: cancer;non-small-cell-lung-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AEU9GNQR/Yang et al. - 2019 - FBXW2 suppresses migration and invasion of lung ca.pdf","","High; Michigan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reduced CMA activity contributes to the decrease in proteome quality in disease and ageing. Here, we report that CMA is also upregulated in response to genotoxic insults and that declined CMA functionality leads to reduced cell survival and genomic instability. This role of CMA in genome quality control is exerted through regulated degradation of activated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by this pathway after the genotoxic insult. Nuclear accumulation of Chk1 in CMA-deficient cells compromises cell cycle progression and prolongs the time that DNA damage persists in these cells. Furthermore, blockage of CMA leads to hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of the MRN (Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1) complex, which participates in early steps of particular DNA repair pathways. We propose that CMA contributes to maintain genome stability by assuring nuclear proteostasis.","2015-04-16","2021-07-01 06:03:02","2021-07-02 22:07:34","2021-07-01 06:03:02","6823","","1","6","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Chaperone-mediated autophagy;DNA damage response;Kinases Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;chaperone-mediated-autophagy;dna-damage-response;kinases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/48A9UDCE/Park et al. - 2015 - Regulated degradation of Chk1 by chaperone-mediate.pdf","","Extreme; NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, establishes the foundations for centromere epigenetic memory and kinetochore assembly. It recruits the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which in turn assembles the microtubule-binding interface. How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural. Here, we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full-length version of CENP-C, the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly. We show that full-length CENP-C, a dimer, binds stably to two nucleosomes and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios closely matching those of endogenous human kinetochores. Our results imply that human kinetochores emerge from clustering multiple copies of a fundamental module and may have important implications for transgenerational inheritance of centromeric chromatin.

Here, we study the cross-talk between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras signaling during lacrimal gland budding morphogenesis. Our results show that PI3K is activated by both the p85-mediated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Ras-mediated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. On the other hand, PI3K also promotes extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via a direct interaction with Ras. Both PI3K and ERK are upstream regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and, together, they prevent expansion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region. We further show that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for induction of lacrimal gland buds. These results reveal that the interplay between PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and mTOR mediates the cross-talk among FGF, IGF, and EGF signaling in support of lacrimal gland development.

Colchicine binds tubulin and depolymerizes microtubules, but it remains unclear how this mechanism blocks myeloid cell recruitment to inflamed tissues. Here we show that colchicine inhibits myeloid cell activation via an indirect mechanism involving the release of hepatokines. We find that a safe dose of colchicine depolymerizes microtubules selectively in hepatocytes but not in circulating myeloid cells. Mechanistically, colchicine triggers Nrf2 activation in hepatocytes, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory hepatokines, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Nrf2 and GDF15 are required for the anti-inflammatory action of colchicine in vivo. Plasma from colchicine-treated mice inhibits inflammatory signalling in myeloid cells in a GDF15-dependent manner, by positive regulation of SHP-1 (PTPN6) phosphatase, although the precise molecular identities of colchicine-induced GDF15 and its receptor require further characterization. Our work shows that the efficacy and safety of colchicine depend on its selective action on hepatocytes, and reveals a new axis of liver–myeloid cell communication.

Due to the role of autophagy in metabolic dysregulation, there is a need to identify autophagy regulators as therapeutic targets. To address this need, we conducted an autophagy phenotype-based screen and identified the natural compound kaempferide (Kaem) as an autophagy enhancer. Kaem promoted autophagy through translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) without MTOR perturbation, suggesting it is safe for administration. Moreover, Kaem accelerated lipid droplet degradation in a lysosomal activity-dependent manner in vitro and ameliorated metabolic dysregulation in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. To elucidate the mechanism underlying Kaem’s biological activity, the target protein was identified via combined drug affinity responsive target stability and LC–MS/MS analyses. Kaem directly interacted with the mitochondrial elongation factor TUFM, and TUFM absence reversed Kaem-induced autophagy and lipid degradation.

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to γ-secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235 mg/kg and 470 mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131).","2021-05-31","2021-07-12 05:33:14","2021-07-12 17:06:20","2021-07-12 05:33:14","1-20","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Bladder cancer;Pharmacodynamics Subject_term_id: bladder-cancer;pharmacodynamics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/SEHF3PYA/Weir et al. - 2021 - Fosciclopirox suppresses growth of high-grade urot.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GPSB8JXS/s41419-021-03836-z.html","","7; Kansas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show that conditionally deleting the essential mTORC2 subunit Rictor in murine brown adipocytes inhibits de novo lipid synthesis, promotes lipid catabolism and thermogenesis, and protects against diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. AKT kinases are the canonical mTORC2 substrates; however, deleting Rictor in brown adipocytes appears to drive lipid catabolism by promoting FoxO1 deacetylation independently of AKT, and in a pathway distinct from its positive role in anabolic lipid synthesis. This facilitates FoxO1 nuclear retention, enhances lipid uptake and lipolysis, and potentiates UCP1 expression. We provide evidence that SIRT6 is the FoxO1 deacetylase suppressed by mTORC2 and show an endogenous interaction between SIRT6 and mTORC2 in both mouse and human cells.

In this report, we define the molecular and metabolic basis of Elovl5 control of FoxO1 phosphorylation. Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S473 [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T308 (PDK1 site). The Akt2 inhibitor Akti1/2 blocked Elovl5 induction of FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S473 and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis-vaccenic acid (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection. Treating HepG2 cells with Elovl5 substrates established that palmitoleic acid (16:1,n-7), but not γ-linolenic acid (18:3,n-6), induced rictor protein, Akt-S473, and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation. Inhibition of FA elongation blocked 16:1,n-7 but not 18:1,n-7 induction of rictor protein and Akt-S473 and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation.

Interestingly, both FOXO1 and thyroid hormone (TH) have similar effects on carbohydrate and energy metabolism as well as overlapping transcriptional regulation of many target genes. Currently, little is known about the regulation of MTORC2-AKT or FOXO1 by TH. Accordingly, we performed hepatic transcriptome profiling in mice after FOXO1 knockdown in the absence or presence of TH, and we compared these results with hepatic FOXO1 and THRB1 (TRβ1) ChIP-Seq data. We identified a subset of TH-stimulated FOXO1 target genes that required co-regulation by FOXO1 and TH. TH activation of FOXO1 was directly linked to an increase in SIRT1-MTORC2 interaction and RICTOR deacetylation. This, in turn, led to decreased AKT and FOXO1 phosphorylation. Moreover, TH increased FOXO1 nuclear localization, DNA binding, and target gene transcription by reducing AKT-dependent FOXO1 phosphorylation in a THRB1-dependent manner. These events were associated with TH-mediated oxidative phosphorylation and NAD(+) production and suggested that downstream metabolic effects by TH can post-translationally activate other transcription factors. Our results showed that RICTOR/MTORC2-AKT can integrate convergent hormonal and metabolic signals to provide coordinated and sensitive regulation of hepatic FOXO1-target gene expression.","2016-01-01","2021-07-12 05:40:59","2021-07-12 16:58:28","","198-214","","1","291","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26453307 PMCID: PMC4697156","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KR9EH4BB/Singh et al. - 2016 - Hepatic FOXO1 Target Genes Are Co-regulated by Thy.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453307","Medium; Medium-High; Singapore","Phosphorylation; Animals; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein; Acetylation; AKT; carbohydrate metabolism; Carrier Proteins; Cell Nucleus; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Enzyme Activation; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; gene regulation; gluconeogenesis; Hep G2 Cells; insulin signaling; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MTORC2; Multiprotein Complexes; NAD; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; RICTOR; Sirtuin 1; thyroid hormone; Thyroid Hormones; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; transcription coregulator; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2).

Activated NRF2 regulates multiple downstream molecules involved in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, translational control, and treatment resistance; however, targeting NRF2 for pancreatic cancer therapy remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used the online computational tool CellMinerTM to explore the NCI-60 drug databases for compounds with anticancer activities correlating most closely with the mRNA expression of NQO1, a marker for NRF2 pathway activity. Among the >100,000 compounds analyzed, NSC84167, termed herein as NRF2 synthetic lethality compound-01 (NSLC01), was one of the top hits (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) and selected for functional characterization. NSLC01 selectively inhibited the viabilities of four out of seven conventional pancreatic cancer cell lines and induced dramatic apoptosis in the cells with high NRF2 activation. The selective anticancer activity of NSLC01 was further validated with a panel of nine low-passage pancreatic patient-derived cell lines, and a significant reverse correlation between log(IC50) of NSLC01 and NQO1 expression was confirmed (r = −0.5563, P = 0.024). Notably, screening of a panel of nine patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) revealed six PDXs with high NQO1/NRF2 activation, and NSLC01 dramatically inhibited the viabilities and induced apoptosis in ex vivo cultures of PDX tumors. Consistent with the ex vivo results, NSLC01 inhibited the tumor growth of two NRF2-activated PDX models in vivo (P < 0.01, n = 7–8) but had no effects on the NRF2-low counterpart. To characterize the mechanism of action, we employed a metabolomic isotope tracer assay that demonstrated that NSLC01-mediated inhibition of de novo synthesis of multiple amino acids, including asparagine and methionine. Importantly, we further found that NSLC01 suppresses the eEF2K/eEF2 translation elongation cascade and protein translation of asparagine synthetase.

These metabolic defects are partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and revert by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. Constitutive hepatic nutrient signaling does not cause hepatocellular damage and carcinomas, unlike genetic activation of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1.

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues.

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). These results demonstrate that in response to CDDP ICLs, TFAs promote p53-dependent apoptosis through the enhancement of the Nox-RIP1-ASK1-MAPK pathway activation, providing insight into the diverse pathogenetic mechanisms of TFAs according to the types of DNA damage.","2021-05-14","2021-07-12 06:07:42","2021-07-12 16:54:41","2021-07-12 06:07:42","10350","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Cell signalling;Kinases;Lipids;Risk factors Subject_term_id: cell-death;cell-signalling;kinases;lipids;risk-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/E79Q5N6V/Hirata et al. - 2021 - trans -Fatty acids promote p53-dependent apoptosis.pdf","","High; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block.

However, α4 KD did increase the phosphorylation of p53 and ATM/ATR substrates, decreased the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and associated fragments. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was reduced, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic BAX protein did not change.

The sensitivity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity was augmented by α4 KD. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of α4 protein in ARVM increased PP2AC expression and augmented H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin. Furthermore, pressure overload-induced heart failure was associated with reduced α4 protein expression, increased ATM/ATR protein kinase activity, increased H2AX expression and Ser139 phosphorylation.

Using a nuclear targeted Akt Substrate-based Tandem Occupancy Peptide Sponge (Akt-STOPS) that we developed for specific inhibition of Akt, a critical upstream kinase, we show that growth factor-stimulated nuclear mTORC1 activity requires nuclear Akt activity. Further mechanistic dissection suggests that nuclear Akt activity mediates growth factor-induced nuclear translocation of Raptor, a regulatory scaffolding component in mTORC1, and localization of Raptor to the nucleus results in nuclear mTORC1 activity in the absence of growth factor stimulation.

We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit route of flaviviruses in LC3+ secretory organelles that enables them to evade circulating antibodies and might affect tissue tropism.","2020-10-15","2021-07-12 06:14:08","2021-07-12 16:49:01","2021-07-12 06:14:08","5189","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Dengue virus;Kinases;Virus–host interactions Subject_term_id: dengue-virus;kinases;virus-host-interactions","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7U69S884/Li et al. - 2020 - Lyn kinase regulates egress of flaviviruses in aut.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MWS2FKUJ/s41467-020-19028-w.html","","UK; Hong Kong; Medium-High","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One degrader induced rapid, durable and highly specific degradation of AURORA-A. In addition, we found that the degrader complex was stabilized by cooperative binding between AURORA-A and CEREBLON. Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding.

We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates. Structures of MAPK-TAD complexes and mechanistic modeling of ATF2 TAD phosphorylation in cells suggest that kinase binding motifs and phosphorylation sites line up to maximize MAPK based co-regulation.

Here, we report that Sam68, an RNA-binding adaptor protein and Src kinase substrate, is a novel regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Both global and hepatic deletions of Sam68 significantly reduce blood glucose levels and the glucagon-induced expression of gluconeogenic genes. Protein, but not mRNA, levels of CRTC2, a crucial transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenesis, are >50% lower in Sam68-deficient hepatocytes than in wild-type hepatocytes. Sam68 interacts with CRTC2 and reduces CRTC2 ubiquitination.

Hepatic Sam68 expression is also upregulated in patients with diabetes and in two diabetic mouse models, while hepatocyte-specific Sam68 deficiencies alleviate diabetic hyperglycemia and improves insulin sensitivity in mice. Thus, our results identify a role for Sam68 in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and Sam68 may represent a therapeutic target for diabetes.","2021-06-07","2021-07-12 06:32:13","2021-07-12 17:17:43","2021-07-12 06:32:13","3340","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Insulin signalling;Mechanisms of disease;Type 2 diabetes;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: insulin-signalling;mechanisms-of-disease;type-2-diabetes-mellitus;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/29W7QTB5/Qiao et al. - 2021 - Sam68 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis via CRTC2.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D93DLBPC/s41467-021-23624-9.html","","High; Already Called; Alabama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrate that BMPER is a driver of insulin sensitivity. Both global and endothelial cell-specific inducible knockout of BMPER cause hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance without increasing inflammation in metabolic tissues in mice. BMPER can directly activate insulin signaling, which requires its internalization and interaction with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), an integral membrane protein that transports intracellular cholesterol. These results suggest that the endocrine function of the vascular endothelium maintains glucose homeostasis.

However, the exact mechanisms of free fatty acid (FFA)-induced podocyte insulin unresponsiveness are poorly understood. We used a type 2 diabetic mouse model (db/db) and mouse podocytes exposed to palmitic acid for 24 h followed by an insulin stimulation. Renal function and pathology were evaluated at 25 weeks of age to confirm the DN development. Our results demonstrate that saturated FFA activated the serine/threonine kinases IκB kinase (IKK)β/IκBα and mTORC1/S6K1, but not protein kinase C and c-jun N-terminal kinase, in podocytes and glomeruli of db/db mice. Activation of both kinases promoted serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1, a residue known to provoke IRS1 inhibition. Using IKK, mTORC1 and ceramide production inhibitors, we were able to blunt IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation and restore insulin stimulation of Akt.

However, its role in mammary oncogenesis remains an unsettled debate as STAT5a exhibits functional dichotomy with both pro-differentiative and pro-proliferative target genes. Phosphorylation of STAT5a serine residues, S726 and S780, may regulate STAT5a in such a way to underlie this duality. Given hematopoiesis studies showing phospho-serine STAT5a as necessary for transformation, we hypothesized that serine phosphorylation regulates STAT5a activity to contribute to its role in mammary oncogenesis, specifically in luminal breast cancer. Here, phosphorylation of S726-, S780-, and Y694-STAT5a in response to prolactin in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells was investigated with STAT5a knockdown and rescue with Y694F-, S726A-, or S780A-STAT5a, where the phospho-sites were mutated. RNA-sequencing and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that loss of each phospho-site differentially affected both prolactin-induced gene expression as well as functional pathways of breast cancer (e.g. cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation). In vitro studies of anchorage-independent growth and proliferation confirmed distinct phenotypes: whereas S780A-STAT5a decreased clonogenicity, S726A-STAT5a decreased proliferation in response to prolactin compared to wild type STAT5a.

In this study, we identified ubiquitous βArrestin 1 (βArr1) as a regulator of AR function in CRPC. Unbiased gene expression analysis of public datasets revealed increased levels of ARRB1 (the gene encoding βArr1) in CRPC when compared to normal tissue. Further, βArr1 expression correlated with enhanced AR transcriptional function in these datasets. The βArr1 partitions to both nucleus and cytosol and mechanistic studies showed that nuclear, and not cytosolic, βArr1 formed a complex with AR and AR-coregulator βCatenin and that the heterotrimeric protein complex was recruited to androgen-response elements of AR-regulated genes. Functionally, we demonstrate that depletion of βArr1 attenuates PC cell and tumor growth and metastasis, and rescued expression of nuclear, but not cytosolic, βArr1 restores the PC colony growth and invasion of Matrigel in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in mice.

The accumulation of damaged or unfolded proteins triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can act as a homeostatic response or lead to cell death. However, the factors involved in turning and adaptive response into a cell death mechanism are still not well understood. Several mechanisms leading to brain injury induced by severe hypoglycemia have been described but the contribution of the UPR has been poorly studied. Cell responses triggered during both the hypoglycemia and the glucose reinfusion periods can contribute to neuronal death. Therefore, we have investigated the activation dynamics of the PERK and the IRE1α branches of the UPR and their contribution to neuronal death in a model of glucose deprivation (GD) and glucose reintroduction (GR) in cortical neurons. Results show a rapid activation of the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4 pathway leading to protein synthesis inhibition during GD, which contributes to neuronal adaptation, however, sustained blockade of protein synthesis during GR promotes neuronal death. On the other hand, IRE1α activation occurs early during GD due to its interaction with BAK/BAX, while ASK1 is recruited to IRE1α activation complex during GR promoting the nuclear translocation of JNK and the upregulation of Chop. Most importantly, results show that IRE1α RNase activity towards its splicing target Xbp1 mRNA occurs late after GR, precluding a homeostatic role. Instead, IRE1α activity during GR drives neuronal death by positively regulating ASK1/JNK activity through the degradation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA, a negative regulator of ASK and an adaptor protein highly expressed in brain, implicated in neuroprotection. Collectively, results describe a novel regulatory mechanism of cell death in neurons, triggered by the downregulation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA induced by the IRE1α branch of the UPR.","2021-06-03","2021-07-12 06:45:23","2021-07-12 16:47:06","2021-07-12 06:45:23","1-15","","1","7","","Cell Death Discov.","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death in the nervous system;Molecular neuroscience;Stress signalling Subject_term_id: cell-death-in-the-nervous-system;molecular-neuroscience;stress-signalling","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D444NY32/Gómora-García et al. - 2021 - IRE1α RIDD activity induced under ER stress drives.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7PRE9AJ7/s41420-021-00518-9.html","","Medium; Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an innate immune effector, ISG12a promotes the innate immune response to viral infection. In this study, ISG12a was found to be expressed at low levels in gastrointestinal cancer, represented by hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC), and it identified as a tumor suppressor that affects clinical prognosis. ISG12a silencing accelerated the malignant transformation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. Mechanistically, ISG12a promoted β-catenin proteasomal degradation by inhibiting the degradation of ubiquitinated Axin, thereby suppressing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, β-catenin was identified as a transcription factor for PD-L1. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ISG12a suppressed expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1, rendering cancer cells sensitive to NK cell-mediated killing. This study reveals a mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of IFN. Some ISGs, as represented by ISG12a, may be useful in cancer therapy and prevention.

However, whether and how arginine methylation directly regulates AKT kinase activity remain unknown. Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), but not other PRMTs, promotes AKT activation by catalyzing symmetric dimethylation of AKT1 at arginine 391 (R391). Mechanistically, AKT1-R391 methylation cooperates with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) to relieve the pleckstrin homology (PH)-in conformation, leading to AKT1 membrane translocation and subsequent activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). As a result, deficiency in AKT1-R391 methylation significantly suppresses AKT1 kinase activity and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we show that PRMT5 inhibitor synergizes with AKT inhibitor or chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance cell death.

Here we show that the tumor suppressor p53 cooperates with Smad proteins, which are TGF-β signal transducers, to selectively activate plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) transcription. p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 in the PAI-1 promoter to recruit histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and enhance histone H3 acetylation, resulting in transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene. Importantly, p53 is required for TGF-β-induced cytostasis and PAI-1 is involved in the cytostatic activity of TGF-β in several cell lines. Our results suggest that p53 enhances TGF-β-induced cytostatic effects by activating PAI-1 transcription, and the functional switching of TGF-β is partially caused by p53 mutation or p53 inactivation during cancer progression.

PBP suppressed TGF-β-mediated cell migration, PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter gene activation, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in various cell types. Furthermore, PBP abolished TGF-β-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression, in addition to the induction of vimentin expression and N-cadherin and fibronectin upregulation, thus blocking TGF-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition in A549 and NMuMG cells.

Because PBP is similar to other BFRs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), additional laboratory and mechanistic studies should be performed to examine BFRs as potential risk factors for tumorigenesis and other TGF-β-related diseases.","2017-02-23","2021-07-12 06:50:35","2021-07-12 17:27:55","2021-07-12 06:50:35","43206","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer microenvironment;Toxicology;Transforming growth factor beta Subject_term_id: cancer-microenvironment;toxicology;transforming-growth-factor-beta","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/NKJWIG7E/Chen et al. - 2017 - Pentabromophenol suppresses TGF-β signaling by acc.pdf","","18; Taiwan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in SSc in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Expression profiling and functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that STAT3 activation is mediated by the combined action of JAK, SRC, c-ABL, and JNK kinases. STAT3-deficient fibroblasts are less sensitive to the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ. Fibroblast-specific knockout of STAT3, or its pharmacological inhibition, ameliorate skin fibrosis in experimental mouse models. STAT3 thus integrates several profibrotic signals and might be a core mediator of fibrosis.

We previously showed that glucose intolerance in LDKO mice is resolved by hepatic inactivation of the transcription factor FoxO1 (that is, LTKO mice)—even though the liver remains insensitive to insulin. Here, we report that insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue of LDKO mice is also impaired but is restored in LTKO mice in conjunction with normal suppression of HGP by insulin. To establish the mechanism by which white adipose tissue insulin signaling and HGP was regulated by hepatic FoxO1, we identified putative hepatokines—including excess follistatin (Fst)—that were dysregulated in LDKO mice but normalized in LTKO mice. Knockdown of hepatic Fst in the LDKO mouse liver restored glucose tolerance, white adipose tissue insulin signaling and the suppression of HGP by insulin; however, the expression of Fst in the liver of healthy LTKO mice had the opposite effect. Of potential clinical significance, knockdown of Fst also improved glucose tolerance in high-fat-fed obese mice, and the level of serum Fst was reduced in parallel with glycated hemoglobin in obese individuals with diabetes who underwent therapeutic gastric bypass surgery. We conclude that Fst is a pathological hepatokine that might be targeted for diabetes therapy during hepatic insulin resistance.","2018-07","2021-07-12 06:55:42","2021-07-12 17:25:59","2021-07-12 06:55:42","1058-1069","","7","24","","Nat Med","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Transforming growth factor beta;Type 2 diabetes Subject_term_id: transforming-growth-factor-beta;type-2-diabetes-mellitus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TXVTQR9T/Tao et al. - 2018 - Inactivating hepatic follistatin alleviates hyperg.pdf","","Boston; 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo.

We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. While TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an <i>Mtor S2159A</i> knock-in allele (<i>Mtor</i><sup>A/A</sup>) using <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promote mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 co-immunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal crosstalk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings.</p>","2021-07-07","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","","","0","0","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 34245780","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XLIJMBCF/Tooley et al. - 2021 - The innate immune kinase TBK1 directly increases m.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4DC8B9HT/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245780","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP axis is known to play an important role in maintaining endothelial barrier function. However, the potential role of protein kinase G-Iα (PKG-Iα) in this protective process is unresolved and was the focus of our study. We describe here a novel mechanism regulating PDE3A activity which involves a protein kinase G-Iα (PKG-Iα)-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of PDE3A at Serine (S)654. We also show that this phosphorylation is critical for maintaining intracellular cAMP levels in the pulmonary endothelium and endothelial barrier integrity. In an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by challenging mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an increase in PDE3 activity and a decrease in cAMP levels in lung tissue was associated with reduced PKG activity upon PKG-Iα nitration at tyrosine (Y)247. The peroxynitrite scavenger manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP) prevented this increase in PDE3 activity in LPS-exposed lungs. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of PDE3A to replace S654 with alanine yielded a mutant protein that was insensitive to PKG-dependent regulation.

SHM is mediated by activation-induced deaminase (AID), occurs at a million times higher frequency than other mutations in the mammalian genome, and is largely restricted to the variable (V) and switch (S) regions of Ig genes. Using the Ramos human Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, we find that H3K79me2/3 and its methyltransferase Dot1L are more abundant on the V region than on the constant (C) region, which does not undergo mutation. In primary naïve mouse B cells examined ex vivo, the H3K79me2/3 modification appears constitutively in the donor Sμ and is inducible in the recipient Sγ1 upon CSR stimulation. Knockout and inhibition of Dot1L in Ramos cells significantly reduces V region mutation and the abundance of H3K79me2/3 on the V region and is associated with a decrease of polymerase II (Pol II) and its S2 phosphorylated form at the IgH locus. Knockout of Dot1L also decreases the abundance of BRD4 and CDK9 (a subunit of the P-TEFb complex) on the V region, and this is accompanied by decreased nascent transcripts throughout the IgH gene. Treatment with JQ1 (inhibitor of BRD4) or DRB (inhibitor of CDK9) decreases SHM and the abundance of Pol II S2P at the IgH locus. Since all these factors play a role in transcription elongation, our studies reinforce the idea that the chromatin context and dynamics of transcription are critical for SHM.","2021-07-20","2021-07-16 14:07:51","2021-07-16 14:07:51","2021-07-16 14:07:51","","","29","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 34253616","","; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4RZVKJEJ/e2104013118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253616","","Dot1L; H3K79me; immunoglobulin variable (V) region; somatic hypermutation (SHM); transcription elongation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After sensing and binding to viral RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RIG-I and MDA5 undergo cytosol-to-membrane relocalization to bind and signal through the MAVS adaptor protein on intracellular membranes, thus directing downstream activation of IRF3 and innate immunity. Here, we report examination of the dynamic subcellular localization of all three RLRs within the intracellular response to dsRNA and RNA virus infection. Observations from high resolution biochemical fractionation and electron microscopy, coupled with analysis of protein interactions and IRF3 activation, show that, in resting cells, microsome but not mitochondrial fractions harbor the central components to initiate innate immune signaling. LGP2 interacts with MAVS in microsomes, blocking the RIG-I/MAVS interaction. Remarkably, in response to dsRNA treatment or RNA virus infection, LGP2 is rapidly released from MAVS and redistributed to mitochondria, temporally correlating with IRF3 activation. We reveal that IRF3 activation does not take place on mitochondria but instead occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes. Our observations suggest ER-derived membranes as key RLR signaling platforms controlled through inhibitory actions of LGP2 binding to MAVS wherein LGP2 translocation to mitochondria releases MAVS inhibition to facilitate RLR-mediated signaling of innate immunity.</p>","2020-07-07","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","2021-08-17 20:43:23","15778-15788","","27","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32571931","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IQQZSGTR/Esser-Nobis et al. - 2020 - Spatiotemporal dynamics of innate immune signaling.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heterodimerization of RAF kinases as well as dephosphorylation of a conserved “S259” inhibitory site are important steps for RAF activation but the precise mechanisms and dynamics remain unclear. A ternary complex comprised of SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 (SHOC2 complex) functions as a RAF S259 holophosphatase and gain-of-function mutations in SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 that promote complex formation are found in Noonan syndrome. Here we show that SHOC2 complex-mediated S259 RAF dephosphorylation is critically required for growth factor-induced RAF heterodimerization as well as for MEK dissociation from BRAF. We also uncover SHOC2-independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK pathway activation that rely on N-region phosphorylation of CRAF. In DLD-1 cells stimulated with EGF, SHOC2 function is essential for a rapid transient phase of ERK activation, but is not required for a slow, sustained phase that is instead driven by palmitoylated H/N-RAS proteins and CRAF. Whereas redundant SHOC2-dependent and -independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK activation make SHOC2 dispensable for proliferation in 2D, KRAS mutant cells preferentially rely on SHOC2 for ERK signaling under anchorage-independent conditions. Our study highlights a context-dependent contribution of SHOC2 to ERK pathway dynamics that is preferentially engaged by KRAS oncogenic signaling and provides a biochemical framework for selective ERK pathway inhibition by targeting the SHOC2 holophosphatase.</p>","2019-07-02","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","2021-08-17 20:54:19","13330-13339","","27","116","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs. ATR inhibitor VE822 combined with PARPi extended survival of mice bearing GSC-derived orthotopic tumors, irrespective of PARPi-sensitivity. These studies identify a role of CDK18 in ATR-regulated HR.

Unlike the well-characterized antiapoptotic chaperone Hsp70, Hsp90 is not a general inhibitor of apoptosis, but it assumes this role in systems such as small-cell lung carcinoma, in which apoptosis is uniquely dependent on and effected through the intrinsic pathway, without involvement of caspase elements upstream of mitochondria or alternate pathways that are not apoptosome-channeled.

Here, we show that Akt activation is a convergent feature of acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, across a spectrum of diverse, established upstream resistance mechanisms. Combined treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and Akt inhibitor causes apoptosis and synergistic growth inhibition in multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer models.

Furthermore, triple combination with AKTi significantly inhibits growth of patient-derived xenografts resistant to combined CDK4/6i and fulvestrant. Finally, high phospho-AKT levels in metastasis of breast cancer patients treated with a combination of CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy correlates with shorter progression-free survival. Our findings support the clinical development of ER, CDK4/6 and AKT co-targeting strategies following progression on CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy combination, and in tumors exhibiting high phospho-AKT levels, which are associated with worse clinical outcome.","2021-08-25","2021-08-28 19:29:54","2021-08-28 19:29:54","2021-08-28 19:29:54","5112","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Translational research Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;translational-research","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RIBG3LZK/Alves et al. - 2021 - Co-targeting CDK46 and AKT with endocrine therapy.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6KL2HTNT/s41467-021-25422-9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a panel pre-clinical models to reveal that PI3K isoform dependency is not governed by loss of PTEN and is impacted by feedback inhibition and concurrent PIK3CA/PIK3CB alterations. Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

Somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have emerged as promising agents for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS-mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. Here, we demonstrate that the selective pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. Our analysis using RNAi and TAK-632 in preclinical models reveals that the MAPK pathway of NRAS-mutated melanoma cells is highly dependent on RAF. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. As a result, TAK-632 demonstrates potent antiproliferative effects both on NRAS-mutated melanoma cells and BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through NRAS mutation or BRAF truncation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor TAK-733 exhibits synergistic antiproliferative effects on these cells. Our findings characterize the unique features of TAK-632 as a pan-RAF inhibitor and provide rationale for its further investigation in NRAS-mutated melanoma and a subset of BRAF-mutated melanomas refractory to BRAF inhibitors.

The development of acquired resistance is inevitable due to the signaling pathway rewiring. Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of these cells. Our study reveals that mTOR activation is essential for drug resistance of melanoma to MAPK inhibitors, and provides insight into the rewiring of the signaling networks in CR melanoma.","2021-07-24","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","2021-08-30 08:16:20","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Melanoma Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;melanoma","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EIVUJNAA/Wang et al. - 2021 - Targeting mTOR signaling overcomes acquired resist.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JBTR26XA/s41388-021-01911-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significantly, nilotinib (2nd generation ABL1/2 inhibitor) reverses resistance, in vivo, causing prolonged regression of resistant tumors, and also, prevents BRAFi/MEKi resistance from developing in the first place.

Robust ERK1/2 activation following MEKi withdrawal drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, selecting against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and reversal of MEKi resistance. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, validating intermittent dosing to forestall resistance. In contrast, resistance driven by KRASG13D amplification is not reversible; rather ERK1/2 hyperactivation drives ZEB1-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance, arguing strongly against the use of drug holidays in cases of KRASG13D amplification.","2019-05-02","2021-08-30 08:36:30","2021-09-07 20:09:35","2021-08-30 08:36:30","2030","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2019 Crown","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapeutic resistance;Growth factor signalling;Kinases Subject_term_id: cancer-therapeutic-resistance;growth-signalling;kinases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/98E78G4S/Sale et al. - 2019 - MEK12 inhibitor withdrawal reverses acquired resi.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VPX7GNWP/s41467-019-09438-w.html","","_company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HSF1 is also involved in chemoresistance, and several studies have demonstrated the relationship between HSF1 and MDR1 but without any consistent results. Paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells showed higher expression of MDR1 and HSF1. Depletion of HSF1 decreased mdr1 expression at mRNA level, and HSF1 directly interacted with the promoter site of mdr1, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator of MDR1. Phosphorylation of Ser303/307, which was involved in protein stability of HSF1 by FBXW7-mediated degradation, was found to be important for transcriptional activation of mdr1. Drug-resistant cells showed decreased expression of FBXW7, which was mediated by the activation of ERK1/2, thus indicating that over-activation of ERK1/2 in drug-resistant cells decreased FBXW7 protein stability, which finally inhibited protein degradation of pHSF1 at Ser303/307. There was a positive correlation between immunofluorescence data of pHSF1 at Ser303/307 and MDR1 in carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors and human lung cancers.

The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of Mdm2, which impedes Mdm2 autoubiquitination and degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization of Mdm2. MARCH7 also promotes Mdm2-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, MARCH7 is able to regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and tumorigenesis via a p53-dependent mechanism. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of Mdm2 and reveal MARCH7 as an important regulator of the Mdm2?p53 pathway.","2018-02-01","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","305-319","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IB4MFKRK/2018 - Regulation of the Mdm2–p53 pathway by the ubiquiti.pdf","","","MARCH7; Mdm2; p53; ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy activation and the development of hypoxic regions within the tumors are known to promote cancer cell resistance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy and hypoxia on the taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol induced apoptosis after 16 h of incubation, and that hypoxia protected MDA-MB-231 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. In parallel, taxol induced autophagy activation already after 2 h of incubation both under normoxia and hypoxia. Autophagy activation after taxol exposure was shown to be a protective mechanism against taxol-induced cell death both under normoxia and hypoxia. However, at longer incubation time, the autophagic process reached a saturation point under normoxia leading to cell death, whereas under hypoxia, autophagy flow still correctly took place allowing the cells to survive. Autophagy induction is induced after taxol exposure via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, which is more important in cells exposed to hypoxia. Taxol also induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and phosphorylation of its substrates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and BCL2-like 1 (BclXL) under normoxia and hypoxia very early after taxol exposure. Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation was decreased more importantly under hypoxia after long incubation time. The role of JNK in autophagy and apoptosis induction was studied using siRNAs. The results showed that JNK activation promotes resistance against taxol-induced apoptosis under normoxia and hypoxia without being involved in induction of autophagy. In conclusion, the resistance against taxol-induced cell death observed under hypoxia can be explained by a more effective autophagic flow activated via the classical mTOR pathway and by a mechanism involving JNK, which could be dependent on Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation but independent of JNK-induced autophagy activation.","2013-05","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","e638-e638","","5","4","","Cell Death Dis","Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells","","","","","","","en","2013 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Breast cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;breast-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/554QSFB4/Notte et al. - 2013 - Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDUUEBQY/cddis2013167.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction &gt;90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.</p>","2015-07-21","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YNHPDB6Z/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VMFKBSNI/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EGFR mutations identify lung cancer patients who can derive benefit from TKIs, but most patients develop resistance to the first-, second-, and third-generation drugs. To explore alternatives to such whack-a-mole strategies, we simulated in patient-derived xenograft models the situation of patients receiving first-line TKIs. Monotherapies comprising approved first-line TKIs were compared to combinations with antibodies specific to EGFR and HER2. We observed uniform and strong superiority of all drug combinations over the respective monotherapies. Prolonged treatments, high TKI dose, and specificity were essential for drug?drug cooperation. Blocking pathways essential for mitosis (e.g., FOXM1), along with downregulation of resistance-conferring receptors (e.g., AXL), might underlie drug cooperation. Thus, upfront treatments using combinations of TKIs and antibodies can prevent emergence of resistance and hence might replace the widely applied sequential treatments utilizing next-generation TKIs.","2021-04-09","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","e13144","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CYLCPIC2/2021 - Upfront admixing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors pr.pdf","","","EGFR TKIs; first-line therapy; mAbs; NSCLC; resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET.

Since the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are frequently upregulated in HCC, we have analyzed the effects of AKT inhibitor MK-2206, MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) and mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055, given as single drugs or in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis of three HCC cell lines in vitro. We show that all three inhibitor combinations synergistically inhibit proliferation of the three HCC cell lines, with the strongest synergistic effect observed after vertical inhibition of AKT and mTORC1/2. We demonstrate that AKT kinase activity is restored 24h after blockade of mTORC1/2 by increased phosphorylation of T308, providing a rationale for combined targeting of AKT and mTOR inhibition in HCC. Our data suggest that a combination of inhibitors targeting those respective pathways may be a viable approach for future application in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","2015","2021-08-30 16:59:49","2021-08-30 16:59:49","","1195-1205","","12","6","","J Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26535060 PMCID: PMC4622849","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P93WE2J6/Ewald et al. - 2015 - Vertical Targeting of AKT and mTOR as Well as Dual.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535060","","mTOR; AKT; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MEK.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These EGFR-dependent tumors eventually become TKI resistant, and the common secondary T790M mutation accounts for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib. However, the key proapoptotic proteins involved in TKI-induced cell death and other secondary mutations involved in resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis and secondary resistant mutations that affect this process. Methods and Findings To study TKI-induced cell death and mechanisms of resistance, we used lung cancer cell lines (with or without EGFR mutations), Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with EGFR mutation constructs, and tumor samples from a gefitinib-resistant patient. Here we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only polypeptide BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11) correlated with gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. The T790M mutation blocked gefitinib-induced up-regulation of BIM and apoptosis. This blockade was overcome by the irreversible TKI CL-387,785. Knockdown of BIM by small interfering RNA was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, from a gefitinib-resistant patient carrying the activating L858R mutation, we identified a novel secondary resistant mutation, L747S in cis to the activating mutation, which attenuated the up-regulation of BIM and reduced apoptosis. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that BIM is involved in TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells and that both attenuation of the up-regulation of BIM and resistance to gefitinib-induced apoptosis are seen in models that contain the common EGFR T790M and the novel L747S secondary resistance mutations. These findings also suggest that induction of BIM may have a role in the treatment of TKI-resistant tumors.","2007-10-30","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","e315","","10","4","","PLOS Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/F6XYEEGA/Costa et al. - 2007 - BIM Mediates EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induce.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; EGFR signaling; Lung and intrathoracic tumors; Mutation detection; Non-small cell lung cancer; Transfection; Tyrosine kinases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the in vitro gefitinib response of four EGFR double mutants identified in untreated patients, including Q787R+L858R, E709A+G719C, T790M+L858R, and H870R+L858R. The phosphorylation profiles of EGFR and downstream effectors AKT, STAT3/5, and ERK1/2 were compared by immunoblot analyses among the single and double mutants transfected into H358 cells. Results showed that mutants responded to in vitro gefitinib treatment with different sensitivities. The G719C and L858R single mutants showed the highest gefitinib sensitivity compared with the corresponding coexisting single mutants E709A, Q787R, H870R, and T790M. The double mutants E709A+G719C, Q787R+L858R, and H870R+L858R showed attenuated responses to gefitinib in the EGFR and downstream effector phosphorylation profiles compared with G719C or L858R alone. T790M+L858R showed strong resistance to gefitinib. Clinically, the patient whose tumor contained H870R+L858R showed tumor stabilization by 250 mg oral gefitinib daily but cerebral metastasis developed 6 months later. Correlation with the in vitro phosphorylation profile of H870R+L858R suggested that treatment failure was probably due to inadequate suppression of EGFR signaling by the drug level attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid at the given oral dosage.

Here, we present a dual mechanism of AKT regulation by the ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1). We show that in cells expressing high levels of EGFR, ERRF1 inhibits growth and enhances responses to chemotherapy. This is mediated in part through the negative regulation of AKT signaling by direct ERRFI1-dependent inhibition of EGFR. In cells expressing low levels of EGFR, ERRFI1 positively modulates AKT signaling by interfering with the interaction of the inactivating phosphatase PHLPP with AKT, thereby promoting cell growth and chemotherapy desensitization. These observations broaden our understanding of chemotherapy response and have important implications for the selection of targeted therapies in a cell context-dependent manner. EGFR inhibition can only sensitize EGFR-high cells for chemotherapy, while AKT inhibition increases chemosensitivity in EGFR-low cells. By understanding these mechanisms, we can take advantage of the cellular context to individualize antineoplastic therapy. Finally, our data also suggest targeting of EFFRI1 in EGFR-low cancer as a promising therapeutic approach.","2018-03-01","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","e44767","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A3FZ2EF4/2018 - Differential roles of ERRFI1 in EGFR and AKT pathw.pdf","","","AKT; AKT inhibitor; EGFR; ERRFI1; PHLPP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore, an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-α, E545K, and H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses, suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-α.

We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner.

We observed that KLF4 was overexpressed in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells and tissues. Knockdown of KLF4 increased tumorigenic properties in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines without c-Met overexpression, but it reduced tumorigenic properties and increased gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with c-Met overexpression, whereas overexpression of KLF4 reduced gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that KLF4 contributed to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins under gefitinib treatment and activating the c-Met/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing the inhibition of β-catenin on phosphorylation of c-Met to prevent blockade by gefitinib.

EPH receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and modulate a diverse range of developmental processes and human diseases. However, the role of C1GALT1 in the signaling of EPH receptors remains largely overlooked. Here, we showed that C1GALT1 high expression in gastric adenocarcinomas correlated with adverse clinicopathologic features and is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. Silencing or loss of C1GALT1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, as well as increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil in AGS and MKN45 cells. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis showed that C1GALT1 depletion suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 induced by soluble Ephrin A1-Fc. O-glycans on EPHA2 were modified by C1GALT1 and both S277A and T429A mutants, which are O-glycosites on EPHA2, dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Y588, suggesting that not only overall O-glycan structures but also site-specific O-glycosylation can regulate EPHA2 activity. Furthermore, depletion of C1GALT1 decreased Ephrin A1-Fc induced migration and reduced Ephrin A1 binding to cell surfaces. The effects of C1GALT1 knockdown or knockout on cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo were phenocopied by EPHA2 knockdown in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that C1GALT1 promotes phosphorylation of EPHA2 and enhances soluble Ephrin A1-mediated migration primarily by modifying EPHA2 O-glycosylation.

Heterogeneity along the EMT spectrum is observed between and within tumors. To develop effective therapeutics, a mechanistic understanding of how EMT affects the molecular requirements for proliferation is needed. We found that although cells use phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) for proliferation in both the epithelial and mesenchymal states, EMT rewires the mechanism of PI3K pathway activation. In epithelial cells, autocrine ERBB3 activation maintains PI3K signaling, whereas after EMT, downregulation of ERBB3 disrupts autocrine signaling to PI3K. Loss of ERBB3 leads to reduced serum-independent proliferation after EMT that can be rescued through reactivation of PI3K by enhanced signaling from p110α, ERBB3 reexpression, or growth factor stimulation. In vivo, we demonstrate that PIK3CA expression is upregulated in mesenchymal tumors with low levels of ERBB3. This study defines how ERBB3 downregulation after EMT affects PI3K-dependent proliferation. Significance: This study describes a mechanism through which EMT transition alters the proliferative potential of cells by modulating ERBB3 expression.

In this present study, we report that SH003, an herbal formulation, induces ER stress via PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling in GC. SH003-mediated ER stress inhibits G9a, a histone methyltransferase, by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation and activates autophagy, indicating to the dissociation of Beclin-1 and autophagy initiation from Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex. However, the inhibition of PERK and CHOP inhibited SH003-induced cell death and autophagy activation. Moreover, targeting autophagy using specific siRNAs of LC3B or p62 or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA also inhibited SH003-induced cell death in GC. Interestingly, SH003 induces BNIP3-mediated autophagic cell death under hypoxia than normoxia in GC. These findings reveal that SH003-induced ER stress regulates BNIP3-induced autophagic cell death via inhibition of STAT3-G9a axis under hypoxia in GC.

A KRAS-specific DARPin fused to the VHL E3 ligase is compared to a pan-RAS intracellular single domain antibody (iDAb) fused to the UBOX domain of the CHIP E3 ligase. We demonstrate that while the KRAS-specific DARPin degrader induces specific proteolysis of both mutant and wild type KRAS, it only inhibits proliferation of cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS in vitro and in vivo.

The MRAS GTPase, a close relative of RAS oncoproteins, interacts with SHOC2 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme that dephosphorylates this S259 RAF site. MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2’s predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS’s unique effector specificity for SHOC2–PP1. MRAS, SHOC2, and PPP1CB are mutated in Noonan syndrome, and we show that syndromic mutations invariably promote complex formation with each other, but not necessarily with other interactors. Thus, Noonan syndrome in individuals with SHOC2, MRAS, or PPPC1B mutations is likely driven at the biochemical level by enhanced ternary complex formation and highlights the crucial role of this phosphatase holoenzyme in RAF S259 dephosphorylation, ERK pathway dynamics, and normal human development.</p>","2018-11-06","2021-08-31 17:21:37","2021-08-31 17:21:44","2021-08-31 17:21:37","E10576-E10585","","45","115","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 . http://www.pnas.org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 30348783","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X2SNWENJ/Young et al. - 2018 - SHOC2–MRAS–PP1 complex positively regulates RAF ac.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ADZXRJA6/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348783","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/W57Z9ILH/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To elucidate the context-selective role of TBK1 in cancer cell survival, we employed a combination of broad-scale chemogenomic and interactome discovery strategies to generate data-driven mechanism-of-action hypotheses. This approach uncovered evidence that TBK1 supports AKT/mTORC1 pathway activation and function through direct modulation of multiple pathway components acting both upstream and downstream of the mTOR kinase itself.

Additionally, Akt signaling has been linked to resistance to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in sarcoma, further demonstrating the role of Akt in tumor survival. This suggests targeting components of the PI3K/Akt pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the in vitro activity of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Buparlisib inhibited activation of Akt and signaling molecules downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) in Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Anti-proliferative effects were observed in both anchorage dependent and independent conditions and apoptosis was induced within 24 hours of drug treatment. Buparlisib demonstrated cytotoxicity as a single agent, but was found to be more effective when used in combination. Synergy was observed when buparlisib was combined with the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The addition of NVP-AEW541 also further reduced phospho-Akt levels and more potently induced apoptosis compared to buparlisib treatment alone. Additionally, the combination of buparlisib with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib resulted in synergy in sarcoma cell lines possessing MAPK pathway mutations. Taken together, these data indicate buparlisib could be a novel therapy for the treatment of pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas.","2015-09-24","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","2021-08-31 17:36:51","e0133610","","9","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7G52CFGJ/Anderson et al. - 2015 - Evaluation of In Vitro Activity of the Class I PI3.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancers and neoplasms; Drug therapy; Ewing sarcoma; Immunoblot analysis; MAPK signaling cascades; Pediatrics; Sarcoma cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, is importantly recognized as intracellular remodeling mechanism of cellular organelles during muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation. Treatment with MitoQ or rapamycin impaired both phosphorylation of ULK1 and expression of Atg proteins.

Here, we show that activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway tightly regulates PD-L1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Both oncogenic and IFNγ-mediated induction of PD-L1 was dependent on mTOR. In human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, membranous expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with mTOR activation. These data suggest that oncogenic activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway promotes immune escape by driving expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer where an mTOR inhibitor combined with a PD-1 antibody decreased tumor growth, increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, and decreased regulatory T cells.

Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the ‘precision medicine’ paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2–6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7–14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher ‘matching score’, was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.","2019-05","2021-08-31 19:59:55","2021-08-31 19:59:55","2021-08-31 19:59:55","744-750","","5","25","","Nat Med","Molecular profiling of cancer patients enables personalized combination therapy","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer genomics;Clinical trials;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: cancer-genomics;clinical-trials;targeted-therapies","<p><strong>Therapy and Matching:</strong></p> <p>A ""treatment"" was considered matched if at least one agent in the treatment regimen targeted at least one aberration, or pathway component alrered in a patient's molecular profile.</p>","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IUFAFBAJ/Sicklick et al. - 2019 - Molecular profiling of cancer patients enables per.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XJUS7CUV/s41591-019-0407-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, tumor cells expressing both CDK4 and CDK6 have increased reliance on CDK6 to ensure cell cycle progression.

NTRK-rearranged cancers have been identified in several cancer types, such as glioblastoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Although there are currently no clinically approved inhibitors that target NTRK1, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as entrectinib and LOXO-101, are in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to identify potential mechanisms of resistance to NTRK inhibitors and find potential therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance. We examined the sensitivity of TPM3-NTRK1-transformed Ba/F3 cells and TPM3-NTRK1-harboring KM12 cells to multiple NTRK inhibitors. Acquired NTRK inhibitor-resistant mutations were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3-TPM3-NTRK1 cells or by the establishment of NTRK-TKI-resistant cells from KM12 cells continuously treated with NTRK-TKIs. We identified multiple novel NTRK-TKI resistance mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain, including G595R, and insulin growth factor receptor type 1 (IGF1R) bypass pathway-mediated resistance. After identifying the resistance mechanisms, we performed drug screening with small-molecule inhibitors to overcome the resistance. As a result, we found that ponatinib and nintedanib effectively inhibited the survival of TPM3-NTRK1-G667C but not G595R mutants, both of which showed resistance to entrectinib or larotrectinib (LOXO-101). Furthermore, cabozantinib with an IGF1R inhibitor such as OSI-906 could overcome bypass pathway-mediated resistance. We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to NTRK inhibitors in cancer with NTRK1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.

The combined results of two clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of entrectinib in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. Because the development of drug resistance is inevitable, it would be helpful to determine the mechanisms of entrectinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged tumor model so that future therapeutic strategies can be developed. Here, we characterized the molecular basis of resistance in entrectinib-resistant ROS1-rearranged HCC78 cells (HCC78ER cells). These cells were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and genetic profiling, which revealed the acquisition of KRAS G12C and the amplification of KRAS and FGF3. However, there were no secondary mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain. We also found that sustained ERK activation was involved in entrectinib resistance, and that combined treatment with selumetinib resensitized HCC78ER cells to entrectinib in cell viability and colony formation assays. Our data suggest that activation of the RAS signaling pathway can cause entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, and is unlikely to be overcome by sequential single agent ROS1-targeting strategies against such tumors. Instead, co-targeting ROS1 and MEK may be an effective strategy for overcoming entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.","2020-04-01","2021-09-07 14:32:09","2021-09-07 14:32:09","2021-09-07 14:32:09","360-368","","2","38","","Invest New Drugs","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/B6WQRT32/Ku et al. - 2020 - Entrectinib resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearrang.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approximately 15% of tumors harboring MET exon14 skipping have concurrent MET amplification. Experimental Design Merestinib is a type II MET kinase inhibitor. Emibetuzumab, a bivalent anti-MET antibody, internalizes MET receptor. Each single agent and the combination were evaluated in the Hs746t gastric cancer line bearing MET exon14 skipping and MET amplification. Results Merestinib inhibited Hs746t cell proliferation (IC50=34 nM) and totally eliminated pMET at 100nM. Emibetuzumab showed little anti-proliferative activity against Hs746t cells (IC50>100nM), did not reduce pMET, and slightly reduced cell surface MET. In the Hs746t xenograft model, dose dependent differences in durability of response were seen with merestinib including durable tumor regression (91.8%) at 12 mg/kg qd. Emibetuzumab treatment (10mg/kg qw) provided transient tumor regression (37.7%), but tumors re-grew while on treatment. Concurrent combination of merestinib (6 mg/kg qd) and emibetuzumab resulted in 85% tumor regression, while a sequential combination (initiating merestinib first) resulted in longer duration of treatment response. Conclusions Data in this study support a clinical evaluation of merestinib in patients with MET exon 14 skipping (NCT02920996). As a type II MET kinase inhibitor, merestinib may provide a therapeutic option to treatment naïve patients or to patients who progress on type I MET inhibitor treatment.

Aberrant activation of c-Met resulting from MET amplification and c-Met overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome in multiple malignancies underscoring the importance of c-Met signaling in cancer progression. Several c-Met inhibitors have advanced to the clinic; however, the development of inhibitory c-Met-directed therapeutic antibodies has been hampered by inherent agonistic activity. Method: We generated and tested a bivalent anti-c-Met monoclonal antibody ABT-700 in vitro for binding potency and antagonistic activity and in vivo for antitumor efficacy in human tumor xenografts. Human cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissue microarrays were examined for MET amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: ABT-700 exhibits a distinctive ability to block both HGF-independent constitutive c-Met signaling and HGF-dependent activation of c-Met. Cancer cells addicted to the constitutively activated c-Met signaling driven by MET amplification undergo apoptosis upon exposure to ABT-700. ABT-700 induces tumor regression and tumor growth delay in preclinical tumor models of gastric and lung cancers harboring amplified MET. ABT-700 in combination with chemotherapeutics also shows additive antitumor effect. Amplification of MET in human cancer tissues can be identified by FISH.

One recognized resistance mechanism occurs through activation of bypass signaling via the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET pathway. INC-280 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET. We sought to demonstrate the activity of INC-280 on select NSCLC cell lines both as a single agent and in combination with erlotinib using exogenous HGF to simulate MET up-regulation. Methods Four NSCLC cell lines (HCC827, PC9, H1666, and H358) were treated with either single-agent INC-280 or in combination with erlotinib with or without HGF. The activity of the drug treatments was measured by cell viability assays. Immunoblotting was used to monitor expression of EGFR/pEGFR, MET/pMET, GAB1/pGAB1, AKT/pAKT, and ERK/pERK as well as markers of apoptosis (PARP and capase-3 cleavage) in H1666, HCC827, and PC9. Results As a single agent, INC-280 showed minimal cytotoxicity despite potent inhibition of MET kinase activity at concentrations as low as 10 nM. Addition of HGF prevented erlotinib-induced cell death. The addition of INC280 to HGF-mediated erlotinib-resistant models restored erlotinib sensitivity for all cell lines tested, associated with cleavage of both PARP and caspase-3. In these models, INC-280 treatment was sufficient to restore erlotinib-induced inhibition of MET, GAB1, AKT, and ERK in the presence of HGF. Conclusion Although the MET inhibitor INC-280 alone had no discernible effect on cell growth, it was able to restore sensitivity to erlotinib and promote apoptosis in NSCLC models rendered erlotinib resistant by HGF. These data provide a preclinical rationale for an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of erlotinib plus INC-280 in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.","2017-05-01","2021-09-07 14:45:16","2021-09-07 14:45:16","2021-09-07 14:45:16","281-285","","3","18","","Clinical Lung Cancer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I97D2CBU/Lara et al. - 2017 - Preclinical Evaluation of MET Inhibitor INC-280 Wi.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EHYIMHB9/S1525730416303606.html","","","AKT; Acquired resistance; Combination therapy; EGFR mutant; ERK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an ongoing phase I trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ROS1 fusions; however, cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in ROS1. Thus, understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required. Experimental Design: The sensitivity of CD74–ROS1–transformed Ba/F3 cells to multiple ALK inhibitors was examined. Acquired ROS1 inhibitor–resistant mutations in CD74–ROS1 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3 cells. To overcome the resistance mutation, we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials. The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the CD74–ROS1–mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74–ROS1. Results: We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain, including the G2032R mutation. As the result of high-throughput drug screening, we found that the cMET/RET/VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184) effectively inhibited the survival of CD74–ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations. Conclusions: We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction >90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.","2015-07-21","2021-09-07 20:14:13","2021-09-07 20:14:13","2021-09-07 20:14:13","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HP2KSHVK/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5G3WE4YT/E3855.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","EGFR inhibition; ERK1/2 paradoxical activation; innate drug resistance; nonsmall cell lung cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although entrectinib is effective in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastases that express NTRK1 fusion proteins, acquired resistance inevitably results in recurrence. The CNS is a sanctuary for targeted drugs; however, the mechanism by which CNS metastases become entrectinib-resistant remains elusive and must be clarified to develop better therapeutics. Experimental Design: The entrectinib-resistant cell line KM12SM-ER was developed by continuous treatment with entrectinib in the brain metastasis–mimicking model inoculated with the entrectinib-sensitive human colon cancer cell line KM12SM, which harbors the TPM3-NTRK1 gene fusion. The mechanism of entrectinib resistance in KM12SM-ER cells was examined by next-generation sequencing. Compounds that overcame entrectinib resistance were screened from a library of 122 kinase inhibitors. Results: KM12SM-ER cells, which showed moderate resistance to entrectinib in vitro, had acquired the G667C mutation in NTRK1. The kinase inhibitor foretinib inhibited TRK-A phosphorylation and the viability of KM12SM-ER cells bearing the NTRK1-G667C mutation in vitro. Moreover, foretinib markedly inhibited the progression of entrectinib-refractory KM12SM-ER–derived liver metastases and brain tumors in animal models, predominantly through inhibition of TRK-A phosphorylation. Conclusions: These results suggest that foretinib may be effective in overcoming entrectinib resistance associated with the NTRK1-G667C mutation in NTRK1 fusion–positive tumors in various organs, including the brain, and provide a rationale for clinical trials of foretinib in cancer patients with entrectinib-resistant tumors harboring the NTRK1-G667C mutation, including patients with brain metastases.

Comprehensive gene-expression profiling revealed that combined treatment with ASNase and GCN2 inhibitors induced the stress-activated MAPK pathway, thereby triggering apoptosis. By using cell-panel analyses, we also showed that acute myelogenous leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells were highly sensitive to the combined treatment.

Although the segregation of RNA into phase-separated condensates broadly affects RNA metabolism3,4, whether and how specific RNAs use phase separation to regulate interacting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and the phenotypic consequences of such regulatory interactions, are poorly understood. Here we show that RNA-driven phase separation is a key mechanism through which a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) controls the activity of RBPs and maintains genomic stability in mammalian cells. The lncRNA NORAD prevents aberrant mitosis by inhibiting Pumilio (PUM) proteins5–8. We show that NORAD can out-compete thousands of other PUM-binding transcripts to inhibit PUM by nucleating the formation of phase-separated PUM condensates, termed NP bodies. Dual mechanisms of PUM recruitment, involving multivalent PUM–NORAD and PUM–PUM interactions, enable NORAD to competitively sequester a super-stoichiometric amount of PUM in NP bodies. Disruption of NORAD-driven PUM phase separation leads to PUM hyperactivity and genome instability that is rescued by synthetic RNAs that induce the formation of PUM condensates. These results reveal a mechanism by which RNA-driven phase separation can regulate RBP activity and identify an essential role for this process in genome maintenance. The repetitive sequence architecture of NORAD and other lncRNAs9–11 suggests that phase separation may be a widely used mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation.","2021-07","2021-09-11 06:40:37","2021-09-11 06:40:37","2021-09-11 06:40:37","303-308","","7866","595","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7866 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Chromosomes;Genomic instability;Intrinsically disordered proteins;Long non-coding RNAs;RNA Subject_term_id: chromosomes;genomic-instability;intrinsically-disordered-proteins;long-non-coding-rnas;rna","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6DNWP5HX/Elguindy and Mendell - 2021 - NORAD-induced Pumilio phase separation is required.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A4693YJ7/s41586-021-03633-w.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under conditions of leucine deficiency, SAR1B inhibits mTORC1 by physically targeting its activator GATOR2. In conditions of leucine sufficiency, SAR1B binds to leucine, undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from GATOR2, which results in mTORC1 activation. SAR1B–GATOR2–mTORC1 signalling is conserved in nematodes and has a role in the regulation of lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that SAR1B deficiency correlates with the development of lung cancer. The silencing of SAR1B and its paralogue SAR1A promotes mTORC1-dependent growth of lung tumours in mice.

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational–experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy.

Failure to properly adapt can lead to pathologies such as hypertension and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to osmotic stress, as well as by signals acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For proper adaptation, the action of these kinases must be coordinated. To identify second messengers of stress adaptation, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics profiling analysis, quantifying nearly 300 metabolites in the yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the MAPK Hog1. Ectopic addition of these BCAA derivatives promotes phosphorylation of the G protein α subunit and dampens G protein-dependent transcription, similar to that seen in response to osmotic stress. Conversely, genetic ablation of Hog1 activity or the BCAA-regulatory enzymes leads to diminished phosphorylation of Gα and increased transcription. Taken together, our results define a new class of candidate second messengers that mediate cross talk between osmotic stress and GPCR signaling pathways.","2017-05-30","2021-09-11 19:02:37","2021-09-11 19:02:39","2021-09-11 19:02:37","e1006829","","5","13","","PLOS Genetics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RJKTGV4M/Shellhammer et al. - 2017 - Amino acid metabolites that regulate G protein sig.pdf","","","Phosphorylation; MAPK signaling cascades; Cellular stress responses; G-protein signaling; Osmotic shock; Protein kinase signaling cascade; Second messenger system; Stress signaling cascade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have indicated that osteocytic RANKL has an important role in osteoclastogenesis during bone remodelling; however, the role of osteoblastic RANKL remains unclear. Here we show that vesicular RANK, which is secreted from the maturing osteoclasts, binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signalling, which activates Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). The proline-rich motif in the RANKL cytoplasmic tail is required for reverse signalling, and a RANKL(Pro29Ala) point mutation reduces activation of the reverse signalling pathway. The coupling of bone resorption and formation is disrupted in RANKL(Pro29Ala) mutant mice, indicating that osteoblastic RANKL functions as a coupling signal acceptor that recognizes vesicular RANK. RANKL reverse signalling is therefore a potential pharmacological target for avoiding the reduced bone formation associated with inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.","2018-09","2021-09-11 19:05:39","2021-09-11 19:05:44","2021-09-11 19:05:39","195-200","","7722","561","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7722 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Antibody fragment therapy;Extracellular signalling molecules;Osteoporosis Subject_term_id: antibody-fragment-therapy;extracellular-signalling-molecules;osteoporosis","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VT843WNK/Ikebuchi et al. - 2018 - Coupling of bone resorption and formation by RANKL.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ82H54G/s41586-018-0482-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around half of all breast cancers with HER2 overexpression co-express hormone receptors (HR) such as those for estrogen and progesterone. Aberrant signaling through HER2 and other members of the HER-family mediates endocrine-resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer. On the other hand, ERα co-expression has been shown to attenuate the efficiency of anti-HER2 therapies. These findings indicate that HER2 and ERα synergize to escape from both anti-ERα and anti-HER2-targeted therapies. Rationally designed clinical trials that combine endocrine therapy with anti-HER2 agents to interfere with HER2/ERα cross-talk have been conducted. However, the outcome of these trials suggests that novel therapeutic approaches are needed to further improve inhibition of HER2 and other HER-family members in conjunction with a more efficient ERα blockade. Here, we demonstrate that carfilzomib and bortezomib stabilize the HER2-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 leading to decreased HER2 autophosphorylation, reduced HER2 activity and subsequently attenuated activation of the PI3K/Akt-pathway, together with blockade of ERα expression. We further observed that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) reverse autophosphorylation and thereby inhibit the activity of constitutively active mutant HER2. We also demonstrate that PIs cause cell death in lapatinib and endocrine-resistant HER2+/ER+ breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that PIs might have the potential to improve the management of HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patients by efficiently disrupting the bi-directional HER2/ERα cross-talk.","2017-09-01","2021-09-11 19:25:04","2021-09-11 19:25:06","2021-09-11 19:25:04","72281-72301","","42","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","eng","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 29069787 PMCID: PMC5641130","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RPJRXRI9/Thaler et al. - 2017 - Proteasome inhibitors prevent bi-directional HER2.pdf","","","Breast Cancer Therapy; Er+/her2+ Breast Cancer; Proteasome inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation by most RTKs and might provide a common resistance node. We found that combining the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 with a MEKi inhibited the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. PTPN11 knockdown/MEKi treatment had similar effects, whereas expressing SHP099 binding–defective PTPN11 mutants conferred resistance, demonstrating that SHP099 is on-target. SHP099/trametinib was highly efficacious in xenograft and/or genetically engineered models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, lung, and ovarian cancers and in wild-type RAS-expressing triple-negative breast cancer. SHP099 inhibited activation of KRAS mutants with residual GTPase activity, impeded SOS/RAS/MEK/ERK1/2 reactivation in response to MEKi, and blocked ERK1/2-dependent transcriptional programs. We conclude that SHP099/MEKi combinations could have therapeutic utility in multiple malignancies. Significance: MEK inhibitors show limited efficacy as single agents, in part because of the rapid development of adaptive resistance.

By searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2. DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38α MAPK. The activated S6K1 forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response and likely in tumorigenesis. S6K1?Mdm2 interaction presents a route for cells to incorporate the metabolic/energy cues into DNA damage response and links the aging-controlling Mdm2?p53 and mTOR-S6K pathways.","2010-09-01","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2994-3006","","17","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/3AUSDVCG/2010 - S6K1 is a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2 that conn.pdf","","","Mdm2; p53; nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling; S6K1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How cancer cells bypass inhibition to prevent maximal response to therapy is not understood. Because KRAS(G12C) cycles between an active and inactive conformation4–6, and the inhibitors bind only to the latter, we tested whether isogenic cell populations respond in a non-uniform manner by studying the effect of treatment at a single-cell resolution. Here we report that, shortly after treatment, some cancer cells are sequestered in a quiescent state with low KRAS activity, whereas others bypass this effect to resume proliferation. This rapid divergent response occurs because some quiescent cells produce new KRAS(G12C) in response to suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase output. New KRAS(G12C) is maintained in its active, drug-insensitive state by epidermal growth factor receptor and aurora kinase signalling. Cells without these adaptive changes—or cells in which these changes are pharmacologically inhibited—remain sensitive to drug treatment, because new KRAS(G12C) is either not available or exists in its inactive, drug-sensitive state. The direct targeting of KRAS oncoproteins has been a longstanding objective in precision oncology. Our study uncovers a flexible non-uniform fitness mechanism that enables groups of cells within a population to rapidly bypass the effect of treatment.

In vitro, sensitivity of KRAS-mutant cells toward the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, is not apparent when cells are grown on plastic in 2D monolayer, but is revealed when cells are grown as 3D multicellular spheroids. This antitumor activity is also observed in vivo in mouse models. Interrogation of the MAPK pathway in SHP099-treated KRAS-mutant cancer models demonstrated similar modulation of p-ERK and DUSP6 transcripts in 2D, 3D, and in vivo, suggesting a MAPK pathway–dependent mechanism and possible non-MAPK pathway–dependent mechanisms in tumor cells or tumor microenvironment for the in vivo efficacy. For the KRASG12C MIAPaCa-2 model, we demonstrate that the efficacy is cancer cell intrinsic as there is minimal antiangiogenic activity by SHP099, and the effects of SHP099 is recapitulated by genetic depletion of SHP2 in cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP099 efficacy in KRAS-mutant models can be recapitulated with RTK inhibitors, suggesting RTK activity is responsible for the SHP2 activation.

To identify differential therapeutic sensitivities between epithelial and mesenchymal lung tumors, we performed in vivo small hairpin RNA screens, proteomic profiling, and analysis of patient tumor datasets, which revealed an inverse correlation between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling dependency and a zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)-regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies determined that MAPK signaling dependency in epithelial lung cancer cells is due to the scaffold protein interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD), which is directly repressed by ZEB1. Lung tumors in multiple Kras mutant murine models with increased ZEB1 displayed low IL17RD expression, accompanied by MAPK-independent tumor growth and therapeutic resistance to MEK inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 function with miR-200 expression or the histone deacetylase inhibitor mocetinostat sensitized resistant cancer cells to MEK inhibition and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth, showing a promising combinatorial treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. In human lung tumor samples, high ZEB1 and low IL17RD expression correlated with low MAPK signaling, presenting potential markers that predict patient response to MEK inhibitors.","2019-03-13","2021-09-11 22:15:24","2021-09-11 22:15:24","","eaaq1238","","483","11","","Sci Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30867319 PMCID: PMC6878763","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/372MF6DA/Peng et al. - 2019 - ZEB1 suppression sensitizes KRAS mutant cancers to.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867319","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Humans; Mice; Benzamides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial Cells; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mesoderm; MicroRNAs; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Mutation; Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Pyrimidines; Receptors, Interleukin-17; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The histological features and mutation statuses of GIST PDXs were consistent with those of the original patient tumors, and the models showed TKI sensitivity comparable to clinical responses. Imatinib inhibited the KIT pathway in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 but not GIST-RX1, RX2, and RX4.

CK6 as a single agent only reduced tumor growth rate in the UZLX-GIST3 model (P = .053, MWU compared to control), while in none of the other GIST models an effect on tumor growth rate was observed. CK6 did not result in significant anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects in any of the GIST models, and moreover, CK6 did not induce a remarkable inhibition of KIT activation. Furthermore, no synergistic effect of combining CK6 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was observed. Conversely, in certain GIST xenografts, anti-tumor effects seemed to be inferior under combination treatment compared to single-agent TKI treatment. In the GIST xenografts tested, the anti-tumor efficacy of CK6 was limited. No synergy was observed on combination of CK6 with TKIs in these GIST models.

The development of effective salvage treatments is complicated by the heterogeneity of KIT secondary resistance mutations. Recently, additional mutations that independently activate KIT-downstream signaling have been found in pretreated patients—adding further complexity to the scope of resistance. We collected genotyping data for KIT from tumor samples of pretreated GIST, providing a representative overview on the distribution and incidence of secondary KIT mutations (n = 80). Analyzing next-generation sequencing data of 109 GIST, we found that 18% carried mutations in KIT-downstream signaling intermediates (NF1/2, PTEN, RAS, PIK3CA, TSC1/2, AKT, BRAF) potentially mediating resistance to KIT inhibitors. Notably, we found no apparent other driver mutations in refractory cases that were analyzed by whole exome/genome sequencing (13/109). Using CRISPR/Cas9 methods, we generated a panel of GIST cell lines harboring mutations in KIT, PTEN, KRAS, NF1, and TSC2. We utilized this panel to evaluate sapanisertib, a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, as a salvage strategy. Sapanisertib had potent antiproliferative effects in all cell lines, including those with KIT-downstream mutations. Combinations with KIT or MEK inhibitors completely abrogated GIST-survival signaling and displayed synergistic effects. Our isogenic cell line panel closely approximates the genetic heterogeneity of resistance observed in heavily pretreated patients with GIST. With the clinical development of novel, broad spectrum KIT inhibitors, emergence of non-KIT–related resistance may require combination treatments with inhibitors of KIT-downstream signaling such as mTOR or MEK.","2019-11-01","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:51","2021-09-11 23:16:52","1985-1996","","11","18","","Mol Cancer Ther","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mct-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Small Molecule Therapeutics PMID: 31308077","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CSPSM55N/Mühlenberg et al. - 2019 - KIT-Dependent and KIT-Independent Genomic Heteroge.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in GISTs and impact KIT expression. Little is known though on KIT-independent targets of KIT-regulating mRNAs. We sought to investigate how miR-494 inhibits GIST proliferation and to identify novel target gene. We used microarray-based gene expression analyses to identify pathways and target genes affected by miR-494. The expressional relationship between survivin and miR-494 was determined in 35 GIST tissues. Cell proliferation assay, FACS analysis, colony formation assay, promoter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) were performed to clarify the roles of survivin in GIST progression. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that miR-494 inhibited GISTs by affecting multiple genes in the cell cycle pathway. Survivin (BIRC5) was a key target of miR-494, and its expression showed an inverse correlation with miR-494 expression in 35 GIST tissues (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = −0.418, p = 0.012). Downregulation of survivin inhibited proliferation and colony formation, and resulted in cell cycle alteration. Induced survivin overexpression relieved miR-494-mediated inhibition of GIST progression. Targeting PI3K effectively suppressed proliferation of GISTs with downregulation of survivin. Survivin also regulated KIT expression at the transcription level. Immunohistochemical analysis using 113 GISTs revealed that survivin expression was significantly correlated with overall survival of GIST patients (p = 0.004). Our findings indicated that miR-494 synergistically suppressed GISTs by concomitantly targeting survivin and KIT.","2018","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2080-2093","","10","142","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.31235","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8ABEBK4F/Yun et al. - 2018 - Survivin is a novel transcription regulator of KIT.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U3WCEKVH/ijc.html","","","gastrointestinal stromal tumor; KIT; miR-494; survivin; vertical blockade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the ERBB2 receptor have recently been reported in breast cancer at diagnosis and also in gastric, colorectal and lung cancer. These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002. Conclusions/Significance Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations. Irreversible ERBB2 inhibitors may offer alternative treatment options for breast cancer and other solid tumor patients harbouring lapatinib resistance mutations. In addition, these inhibitors may be of interest in the scenario of secondary lapatinib resistance.","2011-10-28","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","e26760","","10","6","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JIQCFJFV/Kancha et al. - 2011 - Differential Sensitivity of ERBB2 Kinase Domain Mu.pdf","","","Cancer treatment; Breast cancer; Binding analysis; Cell binding assay; Crystal structure; Gastric cancer; Insertion mutation; Point mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CYH33 significantly inhibited proliferation of a panel of human breast cancer cells, while diversity in sensitivity has been observed. Cells harboring activating PIK3CA mutation, amplified HER2 were more responsive to CYH33 than their counterparts. Besides, cells in HER2-enriched or luminal subtype were more sensitive to CYH33 than basal-like breast cancer. Sensitivity to CYH33 has been further revealed to be associated with induction of G1 phase arrest and simultaneous inhibition of Akt and ERK. Sensitivity of patient-derived xenograft to CYH33 was also positively correlated with decrease in phosphorylated ERK.

Both caused inhibition of AKT, relief of feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, and growth arrest. However, only the PI3K inhibitors caused rapid induction of cell death. In seeking a mechanism for this phenomenon, we found that PI3K inhibition, but not AKT inhibition, causes rapid inhibition of wild-type RAS and of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Inhibition of RAS–ERK signaling is transient, rebounding a few hours after drug addition, and is required for rapid induction of apoptosis. Combined MEK and AKT inhibition also promotes cell death, and in murine models of HER2+ cancer, either pulsatile PI3K inhibition or combined MEK and AKT inhibition causes tumor regression. We conclude that PI3K is upstream of RAS and AKT and that pulsatile inhibition of both pathways is sufficient for effective antitumor activity. Significance: We show that the RAS–ERK pathway is a key downstream effector pathway of oncogenic PI3K. Coordinate downregulation of AKT and ERK is necessary for induction of apoptosis and antitumor activity and can be accomplished with pulsatile dosing, which will likely decrease toxicity and allow administration of therapeutic doses.

We sought to discover predictive biomarker for the efficacy of BYL719 by dissecting the proliferative signaling pathway mediated by PI3K in breast cancer. BYL719 concurrently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in PIK3CA-mutated human breast cancer cells. PI3K-regulated ERK phosphorylation was independent of canonical PDK1/AKT/mTOR pathway, while it was associated with RAF/MEK. Hyper-activation of EGFR or RAS abrogated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by BYL719. Furthermore, hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, c-MET, FGFR and HER3 but not IGF-1R restored ERK phosphorylation and cell viability suppressed by BYL719, suggesting the discriminative functions of RTKs in cell signaling and proliferation. By profiling 22 breast cancer cell lines, we found that BYL719 was more potent in cell lines where phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK was attenuated than those where only AKT phosphorylation was inhibited. The potency of BYL719 was further found to be significantly correlated with the expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer cells. Specifically, overexpression of EGFR, c-MET and/or FGFR1 forecasted resistance, while overexpression of IGF-1R and/or HER2 predicted sensitivity to BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Similar correlation between BYL719 efficacy and expression profile of RTKs was found in patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer. Thus, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 contributes to its antitumor efficacy and is determined by the converged signaling from RTKs. The expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer tissue could be potentially developed as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors.","2017","2021-09-11 23:22:25","2021-09-11 23:22:30","2021-09-11 23:22:25","974-986","","4","7","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HDGXBRNF/Xu et al. - 2017 - Integration of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Determine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intriguingly, this function of KDM4B on UPR requires its demethylase activity but is independent of its canonical role in histone modification, and acts through its cytoplasmic interaction with eIF2α, a crucial component of UPR signaling, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of this component. Targeting KDM4B in combination with PI3K inhibition induces further activation of UPR, leading to robust synergy in apoptosis.

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:27","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/274AZF92/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PSGJGQVZ/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, potential molecular mechanisms by which resistance to this class of drugs occurs have not been investigated. Parsaclisib (INCB050465) is a potent and selective next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitor that differs in structure from first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors and has shown encouraging anti–B-cell tumor activity and reduced hepatotoxicity in phase 1/2 clinical studies. Here, we present preclinical data demonstrating parsaclisib as a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ with over 1000-fold selectivity against other class 1 PI3K isozymes. Parsaclisib directly blocks PI3K signaling–mediated cell proliferation in B-cell lines in vitro and in vivo and indirectly controls tumor growth by lessening immunosuppression through regulatory T-cell inhibition in a syngeneic lymphoma model. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines overexpressing MYC were insensitive to proliferation blockade via PI3Kδ signaling inhibition by parsaclisib, but their proliferative activities were reduced by suppression of MYC gene transcription. Molecular structure analysis of the first- and next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors combined with clinical observation suggests that hepatotoxicity seen with the first-generation inhibitors could result from a structure-related off-target effect. Parsaclisib is currently being evaluated in multiple phase 2 clinical trials as a therapy against various hematologic malignancies of B-cell origin (NCT03126019, NCT02998476, NCT03235544, NCT03144674, and NCT02018861). SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The preclinical properties described here provide the mechanism of action and support clinical investigations of parsaclisib as a therapy for B-cell malignancies. MYC overexpression was identified as a resistance mechanism to parsaclisib in DLBCL cells, which may be useful in guiding further translational studies for the selection of patients with DLBCL who might benefit from PI3Kδ inhibitor treatment in future trials. Hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors may be an off-target effect of that class of compounds.","2020-07-01","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","211-222","","1","374","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 by The Author(s).

PI3Kδ has been validated as a promising target for cancer therapy, and specific PI3Kδ inhibitors were approved for clinical practice. However, the substantial toxicity and relatively low efficacy as a monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) limit their clinical use. In this study, we described a novel PI3Kδ inhibitor SAF-248, which exhibited high selectivity for PI3Kδ (IC50 = 30.6 nM) over other PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels, while sparing most of the other human protein kinases in the kinome profiling. SAF-248 exhibited superior antiproliferative activity against 27 human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines compared with the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib. In particular, SAF-248 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of seven DLBCL cell lines (with GI50 values < 1 μM in 5 DLBCL cell lines). We demonstrated that SAF-248 concentration-dependently blocked PI3K signaling followed by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL KARPAS-422, Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Its activity against the DLBCL cells was negatively correlated to the protein level of PI3Kα. Oral administration of SAF-248 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Activation of mTORC1, MYC and JAK/STAT signaling was observed upon prolonged treatment and co-targeting these pathways would potentiate the activity of SAF-248. Taken together, SAF-248 is a promising selective PI3Kδ inhibitor for the treatment of DLBCL and rational drug combination would further improve its efficacy.","2021-03-29","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","1-11","","","","","Acta Pharmacol Sin","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to CPS and SIMM","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4 inhibitors for PEL.","2016-04-01","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","1797-1810","","14","35","","Oncogene","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 26119939 PMCID: PMC4486341","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YFSGJWJW/Gopalakrishnan et al. - 2016 - Immunomodulatory drugs target IKZF1-IRF4-MYC axis .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes. Finally, targeting AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to anti-EGF receptor targeted therapy.

However, little is known about the effect of sauchinone on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of sauchinone and the underlying mechanism using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model. Sauchinone markedly suppressed FcεRI-mediated activation of positive signaling mediators, including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), phospholipase C (PLC)γ, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Akt, IκB kinase (IKK), and intracellular Ca2+, and increased the activation of negative signaling mediators, including liver kinase B (LKB)1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. Interestingly, sauchinone increased the interaction between SHP-1 and Syk. Consequently, sauchinone significantly suppressed FcεRI-mediated BMMC degranulation and synthesis of eicosanoids and cytokines. These inhibitory effects of sauchinone were diminished in BMMCs treated with siRNAs targeting LKB1, AMPKα2, or SHP-1, and in BMMCs isolated from AMPKα2-deficient mice. In addition, administration of sauchinone markedly suppressed the IgE-mediated PCA reaction in wild-type mice, and this inhibitory effect was significantly reduced in AMPKα2−/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that sauchinone suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis through modulation of the LKB1/AMPK and SHP-1/Syk pathways. Therefore, sauchinone might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.","2019-09-01","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","105702","","","74","","International Immunopharmacology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; Allergy; Mast cell; Sauchinone; Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show here that suckling-weaning and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the glucagon/insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK. Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion under limited-glucose conditions, whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both insulin and glucagon induced AMPKα phosphorylation at its Ser485/491 residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic energy charge. Our results suggest that nutritional changes (i.e. glucose availability), rather than the related hormonal changes (i.e. the glucagon/insulin ratio), sensitize AMPK activation to the energetic stress induced by the dietary transition during fasting. This effect is critical for preserving the cellular energy state in the liver.","2020-05-01","2021-09-11 23:35:04","2021-09-11 23:35:04","2021-09-11 23:35:04","5836-5849","","18","295","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VEBKH77W/Huet et al. - 2020 - Glucose availability but not changes in pancreatic.pdf","","","AMP-activated kinase (AMPK); energy homeostasis; glucagon; glucose; hepatocyte; insulin; liver; metabolic regulation; metformin; nutrient sensing; nutritional transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, using rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model, we found that DHA reduced cell proliferation and viability in RMS cells, but not those in normal cells, which was associated with inhibition of mTORC1. Mechanistically, DHA did not bind to mTOR or FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12).

Rather, DHA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK, ectopic expression dominant negative or kinase-dead AMPK, or knockdown of AMPKa attenuated the inhibitory effect of DHA on mTORC1 in the cells. Additionally, DHA was able to induce dissociation of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor) from mTOR and inhibit mTORC1 activity. Moreover, treatment with artesunate, a prodrug of DHA, dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and concurrently activated AMPK and suppressed mTORC1 in RMS xenografts.

Here, we show that curcumin concentration- and time-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and their downstream substrates in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and this inhibitory effect acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or disruption of TSC1-TSC2 complex by small interfering RNA or gene knockout only partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream signaling, indicating that they are not the primary effectors of curcumin-mediated inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition of these kinases failed to rescue the inhibition by curcumin. Finally, it was shown that the inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling by curcumin is resulted from calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation.

Endogenous Sestrins maintain insulin-dependent AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation during high-fat diet–induced obesity, and overexpressed Sestrins activate AKT in various cell types, including liver and skeletal muscle cells. Although Sestrin-mediated AKT activation improves metabolic parameters, the mechanistic details underlying such improvement remain elusive. Here, we investigated how Sestrin2, the Sestrin homolog highly expressed in liver, induces strong AKT activation. We found that two known targets of Sestrin2, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, are not required for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Rather, phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, kinases upstream of AKT, were essential for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Among these kinases, mTORC2 catalytic activity was strongly up-regulated upon Sestrin2 overexpression in an <i>in vitro</i> kinase assay, indicating that mTORC2 may represent the major link between Sestrin2 and AKT. As reported previously, Sestrin2 interacted with mTORC2; however, we found here that this interaction occurs indirectly through GATOR2, a pentameric protein complex that directly interacts with Sestrin2. Deleting or silencing WDR24 (WD repeat domain 24), the GATOR2 component essential for the Sestrin2–GATOR2 interaction, or WDR59, the GATOR2 component essential for the GATOR2–mTORC2 interaction, completely ablated Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. We also noted that Sestrin2 also directly binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT and induces AKT translocation to the plasma membrane.

The cellular energy sensor and regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was suggested as a putative mediator of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, the leading anthracycline drug, by our earlier work. Here, we study the interference of doxorubicin with AMPK signalling and potentially involved mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of doxorubicin on cell signalling are studied in isolated Langendorff-perfused Wistar rat hearts and in hearts from doxorubicin-treated Wistar rats. In both models, doxorubicin induces energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress. Despite energy depletion and unaffected AMPK upstream signalling, doxorubicin does not activate the AMPK pathway and even reduces basal phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In contrast, oxidative and genotoxic stress do activate pro-survival mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways, the latter via DNA-dependent protein kinase activation triggered by DNA damage. Combined inhibition of AMPK and activation of Akt and MAPK lead to activation of growth-stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the doxorubicin-challenged heart, a combined energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress elicits a specific, hierarchical response where AMPK is inhibited at least partially by the known negative cross-talk with Akt and MAPK pathways, largely triggered by DNA damage signalling. Although such signalling can be protective, e.g. by limiting apoptosis, it primarily induces a negative feedback that increases cellular energy deficits, and via activation of mTOR signalling, it also contributes to the pathological cardiac phenotype in chronic doxorubicin toxicity.","2012-08-01","2021-09-11 23:37:47","2021-09-11 23:37:47","","290-299","","3","95","","Cardiovasc Res","Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22461523","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AP6WY58S/Gratia et al. - 2012 - Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin at t.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461523","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Enzyme Activation; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Disease Models, Animal; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; DNA Damage; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Energy Metabolism; Heart Diseases; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:41:15","2021-09-11 23:41:15","2021-09-11 23:41:15","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QMJ2Z8LE/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.","2009-09-01","2021-09-11 23:42:25","2021-09-11 23:42:25","","6941-50","","","69","","Cancer research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5NBXCPGY/Mühlenberg et al. - 2009 - Inhibitors of Deacetylases Suppress Oncogenic KIT .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26766848_Inhibitors_of_Deacetylases_Suppress_Oncogenic_KIT_Signaling_Acetylate_HSP90_and_Induce_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dramatic metabolic responses following imatinib treatment indicate a high, KIT-dependent glucose turnover which has been particularly helpful for predicting tumor response to imatinib. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibits glucose metabolism in cancer cells that depend on aerobic glycolysis for ATP production. We show that 2DG inhibits proliferation in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines at levels that can be achieved clinically. KIT-negative GIST48B have 3-14-fold higher IC50 levels than KIT-positive GIST cells indicating that oncogenic KIT may sensitize cells to 2DG. GIST sensitivity to 2DG is increased in low-glucose media (110mg/dl). 2DG leads to dose- and glucose dependent inhibition of KIT glycosylation with resultant reduction of membrane-bound KIT, inhibition of KIT-phosphorylation and inactivation of KIT-dependent signaling intermediates. In contrast to imatinib, 2DG caused ER-stress and elicited the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mannose but not pyruvate rescued GIST cells from 2DG-induced growth arrest, suggesting that loss of KIT integrity is the predominant effect of 2DG in GIST. Additive anti-tumoral effects were seen with imatinib and BH3-mimetics. Our data provide the first evidence that modulation of the glucose-metabolism by 2DG may have a disease-specific effect and may be therapeutically useful in GIST.","2015-03-17","2021-09-11 23:42:51","2021-09-11 23:42:51","","e0120531","","","10","","PloS one","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BYWNTNCH/Mühlenberg et al. - 2015 - Inhibition of KIT-Glycosylation by 2-Deoxyglucose .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273786413_Inhibition_of_KIT-Glycosylation_by_2-Deoxyglucose_Abrogates_KIT-Signaling_and_Combination_with_ABT-263_Synergistically_Induces_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, cabozantinib was able to overcome cKIT gatekeeper T670I mutation and the activation loop mutations that are resistant to imatinib or sunitinib. Cabozantinib demonstrated good efficacy in vitro and in vivo in the cKIT mutant-driven preclinical models of GISTs while displaying a long-lasting effect after treatment withdrawal.

Imatinib-resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and little is known about KIT functional roles in imatinib-resistant GIST. Biological consequences of biochemical inhibition of KIT, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), PLCgamma, MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK were determined by immunoblotting for protein activation, and by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in GIST cell lines from imatinib-sensitive GIST (GIST882), imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST430 and GIST48) and KIT-negative GIST (GIST62). KIT activation was 3- to 6-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48 than in GIST882, whereas total KIT expression was comparable in these three GIST lines. In addition to the higher set point for KIT activation, GIST430 and GIST48 had intrinsic imatinib resistance. After treatment with 1 muM imatinib, residual KIT activation was 6- and 2.8-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48, respectively, compared to GIST882. In all GIST lines, cell growth arrest resulted from PI3-K inhibition, and - to a lesser extent - from MEK/MAPK and mTOR inhibition. Inhibition of JAK/STAT or PLCgamma did not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, only PI3-K inhibition resulted in substantial apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant GISTs. We conclude that GIST secondary KIT mutations can be associated with KIT hyperactivation and imatinib resistance. Targeting critical downstream signaling proteins, such as PI3-K, is a promising therapeutic strategy in imatinib-resistant GISTs.","2007-12-01","2021-09-11 23:45:02","2021-09-11 23:45:02","","7560-8","","","26","","Oncogene","KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MEQURLTR/Bauer et al. - 2007 - KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-res.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6290596_KIT_oncogenic_signaling_mechanisms_in_imatinib-resistant_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_PI3-kinaseAKT_is_a_crucial_survival_pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ERK1/2 (ERK) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and is the terminal node of the pathway. BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies are effective in BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and lung cancers; however, responses are short-lived due to emergence of resistance. Reactivation of ERK signaling is central to the mechanisms of acquired resistance. Therefore, ERK inhibition provides an opportunity to overcome resistance and leads to improved efficacy. In addition, KRAS-mutant cancers remain an unmet medical need in which ERK inhibitors may provide treatment options alone or in combination with other agents.

LY3214996 treatment inhibited the pharmacodynamic biomarker, phospho-p90RSK1, in cells and tumors, and correlated with LY3214996 exposures and antitumor activities. In in vitro cell proliferation assays, sensitivity to LY3214996 correlated with ERK pathway aberrations. LY3214996 showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and regression in xenograft models harboring ERK pathway alterations.

Some evidence suggests that sestrins may inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) through inhibition of RagA/B GTPases or activation of AMPK; however, whether sestrins are also involved in mTORC2 regulation and function is unclear. To investigate the functions and mechanisms of Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), we generated Sesn3 liver-specific transgenic and knockout mice. Our data show that Sesn3 liver-specific knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and Sesn3 transgenic mice were protected against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Using AMPK liver-specific knockout mice, we demonstrate that the Sesn3 insulin-sensitizing effect is largely independent of AMPK. Biochemical analysis reveals that Sesn3 interacts with and activates mTORC2 and subsequently stimulates Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings suggest that Sesn3 can activate Akt via mTORC2 to regulate hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.","2015-04-01","2021-09-11 23:53:52","2021-09-11 23:53:57","2021-09-11 23:53:52","1211-1223","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

The signalling pathways downstream of IL11 are contentious and both STAT3 and ERK have been implicated. Here we show that TGFβ1- or IL11- induced ERK activation is consistently associated with fibrogenesis whereas STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is unrelated to fibroblast activation. Surprisingly, recombinant human IL11, which has been used extensively in mouse experiments to infer STAT3 activity downstream of IL11, non-specifically increases pSTAT3 in Il11ra1 null mouse fibroblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 prevents TGFβ1-induced fibrogenesis but this effect was found to reflect fibroblast dysfunction due to severe proteotoxic ER stress. In contrast, inhibition of MEK/ERK prevented fibrosis in the absence of ER stress. TGFβ1-stimulated ERK/mTOR/P70RSK-driven protein translation was IL11-dependent and selectivity for pro-fibrotic protein synthesis was ascribed to an EPRS-related mechanism. In TGFβ1-stimulated fibroblasts, the anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib caused dose-dependent ER stress, reduced pSTAT/pERK and inhibited pro-fibrotic protein translation, similarly to generic STAT3 inhibitors or ER stressors. Pirfenidone, while anti-fibrotic, had no effect on ER stress whereas anti-IL11 inhibited the ERK/mTOR axis while reducing ER stress. These studies discount a specific role for STAT3 in pro-fibrotic signaling, suggest a novel mechanism of action for nintedanib and prioritise further the IL11 pathway as a therapeutic target for fibrosis.","2021-06-10","2021-09-11 23:55:36","2021-09-11 23:55:37","2021-09-11 23:55:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2021.06.10.447846","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2PKUYV5C/Widjaja et al. - 2021 - Molecular dissection of pro-fibrotic signaling ide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We validated compounds that stabilized or destabilized MYC and then focused on one compound, UNC10112785, that induced the substantial loss of MYC protein in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell cultures. We determined that this compound is a potent CDK9 inhibitor with a previously uncharacterized scaffold, caused MYC loss through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, and suppresses PDAC anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. We discovered that CDK9 enhanced MYC protein stability through a previously unknown, KRAS-independent mechanism involving direct phosphorylation of MYC at Ser62 Our study thus not only identifies a potential therapeutic target for patients with KRAS-mutant PDAC but also presents the application of a screening strategy that can be more broadly adapted to identify regulators of protein stability.","2019-07-16","2021-09-12 00:05:09","2021-09-12 00:05:09","","eaav7259","","590","12","","Sci Signal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31311847 PMCID: PMC6728149","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MTLMAHUQ/Blake et al. - 2019 - Application of a MYC degradation screen identifies.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311847","","Phosphorylation; Humans; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Protein Stability; Proteolysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Small Molecule Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of oligomeric architectures adopted by DegP are thought to facilitate its function. For example, DegP can form a “resting” hexamer when not engaged to substrates, mitigating undesired proteolysis of cellular proteins. When bound to substrate proteins or lipid membranes, DegP has been shown to populate a variety of cage- or bowl-like oligomeric states that have increased proteolytic activity. Though a number of DegP’s substrate-engaged structures have been robustly characterized, detailed mechanistic information underpinning its remarkable oligomeric plasticity and the corresponding interplay between these dynamics and biological function has remained elusive. Here, we have used a combination of hydrodynamics and NMR spectroscopy methodologies in combination with cryogenic electron microscopy to shed light on the apo-DegP self-assembly mechanism. We find that, in the absence of bound substrates, DegP populates an ensemble of oligomeric states, mediated by self-assembly of trimers, that are distinct from those observed in the presence of substrate. The oligomeric distribution is sensitive to solution ionic strength and temperature and is shifted toward larger oligomeric assemblies under physiological conditions. Substrate proteins may guide DegP toward canonical cage-like structures by binding to these preorganized oligomers, leading to changes in conformation. The properties of DegP self-assembly identified here suggest that apo-DegP can rapidly shift its oligomeric distribution in order to respond to a variety of biological insults.","2021-08-10","2021-09-14 00:30:21","2021-09-14 00:30:30","2021-09-14 00:30:21","","","32","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 34362850","","; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GPF4D39Z/e2109732118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362850","","hydrodynamics; methyl-TROSY NMR; protein self-assembly; protein thermodynamics and kinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, but its regulation remains poorly defined. Here we show that depletion of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor, resulted in NLRP3- and ASC (apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain)-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 engagement. TLR2 or TLR4 agonist induced PAI-2 expression, which subsequently stabilized the autophagic protein Beclin 1 to promote autophagy, resulting in decreases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, NLRP3 protein level, and pro-IL-1β processing. Likewise, overexpressing Beclin 1 in PAI-2-deficient cells rescued the suppression of NLRP3 activation in response to LPS.

We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition repressed GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII.","2017-12-15","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","20720-20731","","50","292","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GMIUT3C4/Haj et al. - 2017 - Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 is .pdf","","","chromatin; histone modification; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); phosphorylation; pituitary gland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously reported that TRAF2 is phosphorylated following TNF stimulation and now identify the PKC kinases responsible for phosphorylation. Phosphorylated TRAF2 facilitates recruitment of IKKα and IKKβ to the TNF receptor. Phosphorylation also determines K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2 at lysine 31. TRAF2 K63-linked ubiquitination contributes to associations with TAB2/3 and activation of the downstream IKK and JNK kinases.

Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1–dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1–induced formation of K63-Ub chains and ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains. The early phase of TLR signaling and the TLR-dependent secretion of IL-10 (controlled by IRAKs 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6[L74H] mutant, but the late-phase production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα (controlled only by the pseudokinase IRAK2) was abolished. RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice. We identify two essential roles of TRAF6 that are independent of its E3 ligase activity.","2017-04-25","2021-09-14 05:23:32","2021-09-14 05:23:35","2021-09-14 05:23:32","E3481-E3489","","17","114","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","©  .

Stk24 deficiency or knockdown markedly inhibited IL-17-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB and impaired IL-17-induced chemokines and cytokines expression. Stk24 overexpression greatly enhanced IL-17-induced NF-κB activation and expression of chemokines and cytokines in a kinase activity-independent manner. The IL-17-induced inflammatory response was significantly reduced in Stk24-deficient mice. In addition, the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was markedly reduced in mice with a deficiency of Stk24 in non-hematopoietic cells. We further demonstrated that Stk24 directly interacts with TAK1 and IKKβ and promotes the formation of TAK1/IKK complexes, leading to enhanced IKKβ/NF-κB activation and downstream cytokines and chemokines induction.

However, pharmacologically activated p53 can induce diverse responses ranging from cell death to growth arrest and DNA repair, which limits the efficient application of p53-reactivating drugs in clinic. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms defining the biological outcome upon p53 activation remains a grand challenge in the p53 field. Here, we report that concurrent pharmacological activation of p53 and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), result in the synthetic lethality in cancer cells. ROS promote the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and DNA damage response, which establishes a positive feedback loop with p53. This converts the p53-induced growth arrest/senescence to apoptosis. We identified several survival oncogenes inhibited by p53 in JNK-dependent manner, including Mcl1, PI3K, eIF4E, as well as p53 inhibitors Wip1 and MdmX. Further, we show that Wip1 is one of the crucial executors downstream of JNK whose ablation confers the enhanced and sustained p53 transcriptional response contributing to cell death. Our study provides novel insights for manipulating p53 response in a controlled way. Further, our results may enable new pharmacological strategy to exploit abnormally high ROS level, often linked with higher aggressiveness in cancer, to selectively kill cancer cells upon pharmacological reactivation of p53.","2014-04","2021-09-14 05:26:06","2021-09-14 05:26:09","2021-09-14 05:26:06","612-623","","4","21","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2014 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Cancer therapy;Pharmacology Subject_term_id: apoptosis;cancer-therapy;pharmacology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSRSI3RX/Shi et al. - 2014 - ROS-dependent activation of JNK converts p53 into .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, MYC, a potent oncogene, is an antinecroptotic factor that directly suppresses the formation of the RIPK1–RIPK3 complex. Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that the MYC pathway is the most prominently down-regulated signaling pathway during necroptosis. Depletion or deletion of MYC promotes the RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction, thereby stabilizing the RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and facilitating necroptosis. Interestingly, MYC binds to RIPK3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in vitro. Furthermore, MYC-nick, a truncated form that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, prevented TNF-induced necroptosis. Finally, down-regulation of MYC enhances necroptosis in leukemia cells and suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model upon treatment with birinapant and emricasan. MYC-mediated suppression of necroptosis is a mechanism of necroptosis resistance in cancer, and approaches targeting MYC to induce necroptosis represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer.","2020-08-18","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","19982-19993","","33","117","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/43BUNHPP/Seong et al. - 2020 - Identification of MYC as an antinecroptotic protei.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation is still unclear. Here we report that the expression of cytokines is robustly upregulated in a cell-autonomous manner during necroptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). We demonstrate that TNFα-induced necroptosis leads to two waves of cytokine production. The first wave, more transient and weaker than the second, is in response to TNFα alone; whereas the second wave depends upon the necroptotic signaling. We show that necroptosis promotes the transcription of TNFα-target genes in a cell-intrinsic manner. The activation of both NF-κB and p38 by the necroptotic machinery, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, is involved in mediating the robust induction of cytokine expression in the second wave. In contrast, necroptosis induced by direct oligomerization of MLKL promotes cytokine production at much lower levels than that of necroptosis induced with TNFα. Thus, we conclude that TNFα-induced necroptosis signaling events mediated by RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation, in addition to the MLKL oligomerization, promotes the expression of cytokines involving multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms including NF-κB pathway and p38. These findings reveal that the necroptotic cell death machinery mounts an immune response by promoting cell-autonomous production of cytokines. Our study provides insights into the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation in human diseases.","2018-04-27","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","1-16","","5","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2YPPXFNL/Zhu et al. - 2018 - Necroptosis promotes cell-autonomous activation of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Macrophages are key innate immune cells that upon encountering pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing cytokines, including IFN-β. In this study, we identify a novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing IFN-β production in macrophages. Using genetic and pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1 directs IFN-β synthesis induced by LPS in mice. Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase–dependent IFN-β production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in bone marrow–derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases. Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1 and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF–dependent IFN-β production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4. Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase–dependent synthesis of IFN-β is markedly induced by avirulent strains of Gram-negative bacteria, Yersinia and Klebsiella, and less so by their wild-type counterparts. Overall, these observations identify unexpected roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases in the production of IFN-β during the host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and suggest that the axis in which these kinases operate may represent a target for bacterial virulence factors.","2017-06-01","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","4435-4447","","11","198","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","","","","www.jimmunol.org","","Publisher: American Association of Immunologists Section: INNATE IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION PMID: 28461567","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FJB9MMXU/Saleh et al. - 2017 - Kinase Activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 Can Direct IF.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental Design: MK-2206 effects on cell signaling were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Results: MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity. Stable transfection of PIK3CA E545K or H1047R mutant plasmids into normal-like MCF10A breast cells enhanced MK-2206 sensitivity. Cell lines that were less sensitive to MK-2206 had lower ratios of Akt1/Akt2 and had less growth inhibition with Akt siRNA knockdown. In PTEN-mutant ZR75-1 breast cancer xenografts, MK-2206 treatment inhibited Akt signaling, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206–sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. Conclusions: MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

We have developed an approach based on the inducible recruitment of a Ras-GAP that enforces endogenous Ras inhibition within minutes. Applying this strategy to inhibit Ras stepwise in synchronous cell populations revealed that Ras signaling was required well into G1 for Cyclin D induction, pocket protein phosphorylation and S-phase entry, irrespective of whether cells emerged from quiescence or G2/M. Unexpectedly, Erk, and not PI3K/Akt or Ral was activated by Ras at mid-G1, albeit PI3K/Akt signalling was a necessary companion of Ras/Erk for sustaining cyclin-D levels and G1/S transition.

Although rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for the treatment of certain cancers, major success in targeting mTOR, particularly with new generation mTOR kinase inhibitors, for the effective treatment of cancers has not been achieved. Hence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the mTOR axis in cancer is still needed. It is now recognized that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on cancer cells is a critical mechanism contributing to immunosuppression and immune escape via interacting with program death-1 (PD-1) on immune cells. This study has revealed a previously undiscovered role of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the negative regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that disruption of this signaling pathway with mTOR inhibitors, raptor knockdown or p70S6K inhibitors elevated PD-L1 levels in some lung and other cancer cell lines. Elevation of PD-L1 by inhibition of mTORC1/p70S6K signaling is likely due to suppression of β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation of PD-L1, because inhibition of either mTORC1 or p70S6K facilitated β-TrCP degradation accompanied with enhanced PD-L1 protein stabilization. Our current findings indicate the complexity of the mTOR axis in cancer, which should be considered when targeting this axis for effective cancer treatment. Our findings also suggest a strong scientific rationale for enhancing PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy through co-targeting mTORC1/p70S6K signaling.","2019-08","2021-09-14 06:07:28","2021-09-14 06:07:31","2021-09-14 06:07:30","6270-6282","","35","38","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 35 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour immunology Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-immunology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/K7SGNPBL/Deng et al. - 2019 - Inhibition of mTOR complex 1p70 S6 kinase signali.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R3ZA8SHW/s41388-019-0877-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we hypothesised that a coordinated network of multi-RTK activation contributes to mesothelioma tumorigenesis.","2014-05","2021-09-14 06:09:20","2021-09-14 06:09:20","2021-09-14 06:09:20","2479-2488","","10","110","","Br J Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2014 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 10 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Mesothelioma;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;mesothelioma;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P6R259JE/Zhou et al. - 2014 - Multipoint targeting of the PI3KmTOR pathway in m.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6V8TR9W8/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation. Treatment with MitoQ or rapamycin impaired both phosphorylation of ULK1 and expression of Atg proteins.

However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition.

This report shows PRAS40 is regulated by AKT in cardiomyocytes and that AKT-driven phosphorylation relieves the inhibitory function of PRAS40. PRAS40 overexpression in vitro blocks mTORC1 in cardiomyocytes and decreases pathological growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.","2013-07-30","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","12661-12666","","31","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 23842089","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XE8FZ5F6/Völkers et al. - 2013 - Pathological hypertrophy amelioration by PRAS40-me.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P2E7ZRTE/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While Tanc2-null mice show embryonic lethality, Tanc2-haploinsufficient mice survive but display mTORC1/2 hyperactivity accompanying synaptic and behavioral deficits reversed by mTOR-inhibiting rapamycin. Tanc2 interacts with and inhibits mTOR, which is suppressed by mTOR-activating serum or ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant. Tanc2 and Deptor, also known to inhibit mTORC1/2 minimally affecting neurodevelopment, distinctly inhibit mTOR in early- and late-stage neurons.

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo.

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts.

We demonstrate that this metabolic vulnerability is driven by mTORC1, which promotes resistance to chemotherapy and targeted cancer drugs, but simultaneously suppresses autophagy. We show that autophagy is essential for tumor cells to cope with therapeutic perturbation of metabolism and that mTORC1-mediated suppression of autophagy is required and sufficient for generating a metabolic vulnerability leading to energy crisis and apoptosis.

As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.","2016-08","2021-09-14 06:21:58","2021-09-14 06:22:03","2021-09-14 06:21:58","4518-4528","","34","35","","","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 34 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Bladder cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;bladder-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X36V87I3/King et al. - 2016 - Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies syn.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/T8X5PHIU/onc2015511.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 α-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNFα-induced neurotoxicity. Opposite to the Alzheimer Disease transgenic mice, the PDK1 knock-in mice exhibited an age-dependent attenuation of the unfolding protein response, which protected the mutant neurons against endoplasmic reticulum stressors.

We showed that SP (5−20 mM) dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines JIMT-1 (ER-negative and HER2-expressing) and MCF7 (ER-positive type), and this effect was not affected by PTX, thus not mediated by the GPR41 or GPR43 SCFA receptors. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that SP treatment increased autophagic and antioxidant activity in JIMT-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells, which might be a compensatory mechanism to overcome SP-induced apoptosis, but were not sufficient to overcome SP-mediated suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. We revealed that the anticancer effect of SP was mediated by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 signaling which led to cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and increasing levels of ROS and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK which induced apoptosis. In nude mice bearing JIMT-1 and MCF7 cells xenograft, administration of SP (20 mg/mL in drinking water) significantly suppressed tumor growth by regulating STAT3 and p38 in tumor tissues.

This defect rendered accumulation of DNA damage in p53 mutant cells upon treatment with deoxyuridine analogues. Notably, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) greatly enhanced this response, whereas normal cells responded with activation of the p53-p21 axis and cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of either p53 or p21/CDKN1A conferred the p53 mutant phenotype. Preclinical animal studies demonstrated a greater anti-neoplastic efficacy of the drug combination (deoxyuridine analogue and PARP inhibitor) than either drug alone.

These tumors express several activated tyrosine kinase receptors, which prompted attempts to treat patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although clinical benefit was observed in phase II clinical trials with imatinib and sorafenib, and sporadically also with EGFR inhibitors, therapies evaluated to date have shown modest activity. With the goal of identifying new drugs with immediate therapeutic potential for chordoma patients, we collected clinically approved drugs and other advanced inhibitors of MET, PDGFRβ, and EGFR tyrosine kinases, and assessed their antiproliferative activity against a panel of chordoma cell lines. Chordoma cell lines were not responsive to MET and PDGFRβ inhibitors. U-CH1 and UM-Chor1 were sensitive to all EGFR inhibitors, whereas the remaining cell lines were generally insensitive to these drugs. Afatinib was the only EGFR inhibitor with activity across the chordoma panel. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the responses observed and found that the antiproliferative IC50s correlate with the unique ability of afatinib to promote degradation of EGFR and brachyury, an embryonic transcription factor considered a key driver of chordoma. Afatinib displayed potent antitumor efficacy in U-CH1, SF8894, CF322, and CF365 chordoma tumor models in vivo. In the panel analyzed, high EGFR phosphorylation and low AXL and STK33 expression correlated with higher sensitivity to afatinib and deserve further investigation as potential biomarkers of response. These data support the use of afatinib in clinical trials and provide the rationale for the upcoming European phase II study on afatinib in advanced chordoma.

To identify the mechanism by which Src overexpression sustains this resistance, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines either sensitive or resistant to lapatinib. Methods: To determine the role of Src in lapatinib resistance, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition/silencing in vitro on survival, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. In vivo experiments were performed in JIMT-1 lapatinib-resistant cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice. We used artificial metastasis assays to evaluate the effect of Src inhibition on the invasiveness of lapatinib-resistant cells. Src-dependent signal transduction was investigated with Western blot and ELISA analyses. Results: Src activation was higher in lapatinib-resistant than in lapatinib-sensitive cells. The selective small-molecule Src inhibitor saracatinib combined with lapatinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. Saracatinib combined with lapatinib significantly prolonged survival of JIMT-1-xenografted mice compared with saracatinib alone, and impaired the formation of lung metastases. Unexpectedly, in lapatinib-resistant cells, Src preferentially interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rather than with HER2. Moreover, EGFR targeting and lapatinib synergistically inhibited survival, migration, and invasion of resistant cells, thereby counteracting Src-mediated resistance. These findings demonstrate that Src activation in lapatinib-resistant cells depends on EGFRdependent rather than on HER2-dependent signaling. Conclusions: Complete pharmacologic EGFR/HER2 inhibition is required to reverse Src-dependent resistance to lapatinib in breast cancer.","2014-06","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","R45","","3","16","","Breast Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D7D5JJ2J/Formisano et al. - 2014 - Epidermal growth factor-receptor activation modula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental Design: To evaluate the biologic consequences of specific targeting of STAT3 in neuroblastoma, we assessed the effect of tetracycline (Tet)-inducible STAT3 shRNA and the generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotide AZD9150 which targets STAT3 in three representative neuroblastoma cell line models (AS, NGP, and IMR32). Results: Our data indicated that Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 inhibited endogenous STAT3 and STAT3 target genes. Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 decreased cell growth and tumorigenicity. In vivo, STAT3 inhibition by Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA or AZD9150 alone had little effect on growth of established tumors. However, when treated xenograft tumor cells were reimplanted into mice, there was a significant decrease in secondary tumors in the mice receiving AZD9150-treated tumor cells compared with the mice receiving ntASO-treated tumor cells. This indicates that inhibition of STAT3 decreases the tumor-initiating potential of neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 significantly increased neuroblastoma cell sensitivity to cisplatin and decreased tumor growth and increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Conclusions: Our study supports the development of strategies targeting STAT3 inhibition in combination with conventional chemotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-14 06:31:33","2021-09-14 06:31:46","2021-09-14 06:31:33","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LQSC4S7/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CCIY9SF9/282.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We seek to evaluate the efficacy and synergistic mechanisms of combinations with a novel SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, to inform their clinical development. Experimental Design: The combinations of TNO155 with EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi), BRAFi, KRASG12Ci, CDK4/6i, and anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody were tested in appropriate cancer models in vitro and in vivo, and their effects on downstream signaling were examined. Results: In EGFR-mutant lung cancer models, combination benefit of TNO155 and the EGFRi nazartinib was observed, coincident with sustained ERK inhibition. In BRAFV600E colorectal cancer models, TNO155 synergized with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors by blocking ERK feedback activation by different RTKs. In KRASG12C cancer cells, TNO155 effectively blocked the feedback activation of wild-type KRAS or other RAS isoforms induced by KRASG12Ci and greatly enhanced efficacy. In addition, TNO155 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib showed combination benefit in a large panel of lung and colorectal cancer patient–derived xenografts, including those with KRAS mutations. Finally, TNO155 effectively inhibited RAS activation by colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is critical for the maturation of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, and showed combination activity with anti–PD-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings suggest TNO155 is an effective agent for blocking both tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive RTK signaling in RTK- and MAPK-driven cancers and their tumor microenvironment.

To treat lung cancer, various anticancer drugs were developed and tested, but they failed because of drug resistance. In the present study, we tested herbal medicines, such as TK and CuD, as anticancer drugs to decrease side effects and resistance. Methods Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. Analysis of cell cycle arrest was performed by flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis by cucurbitacin D was measured by an annexin V-FITC/PI assay. We performed RTK kit analysis. Levels of p-ErbB3, p-STAT3, p-NF-κB, and caspases were measured by western blot analysis. Nuclear staining of ErbB3 was measured by immunocytochemistry. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and NF-κB was detected by STAT3 and NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assays. Results We found a synergistic effect of TK with CDDP and PXD in primary culture of human NSCLC tumor cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced sub-G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced apoptosis, regulated apoptotic molecules, caused morphological changes and inhibited colony formation in H1299 cells. We found that TK suppresses p-ErbB3 expression and signaling. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-AKT, p-Erk, and p-JNK signaling and suppressed Stat3 and NF-κB transcriptional activity in H1299 cells. More importantly, the combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-ErbB3 and downstream molecules in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited ErbB2/ErbB3 dimerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that the synergistic effect of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling. Conclusion The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD decreases cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling in H1299 lung cancer cells. TK or CuD could be useful as a compound to treat lung cancer. Additionally, targeting ErbB3 may also be useful for treating lung cancer.","2020-01-01","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","153109","","","66","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2W66ZDYR/Ku et al. - 2020 - Synergistic anticancer effect of combined use of T.pdf","","","Lung cancer; Cisplatin; Cucurbitacin D; ErbB3; Pemetrexed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no effective therapy for patients with metastatic UM. Improved treatments of hepatic metastatic patients with UM were urgently needed. Inspired by readily detectable key components in the neddylation pathway in UM cells, we aimed at exploring whether neddylation pathway was a therapeutic target for liver metastatic UM. Experimental Design: Expression of key proteins in the neddylation pathway in UM was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemical staining. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) properties were examined upon treatment with MLN4924, a potent and selective NAE inhibitor. Antitumor activity and frequency of CSCs were determined by using a NOD-SCID mouse xenograft model. Liver metastasis was evaluated by use of a NOD-scid-IL2Rg−/− mouse model. Results: NAE1 expression was readily detectable in UM. Inhibition of the neddylation pathway by MLN4924 repressed the CSCs properties in UM (capacities of tumorsphere formation and serially replating, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive cells, and frequency of CSC) through Slug protein degradation. MLN4924 treatment disturbed the paracrine secretion of NF-κB-mediated VEGF-C and its dependent angiogenesis. The inhibitory effect of neddylation blockade on proliferation, which was confirmed by xenografted UM tumor in NOD-SCID mice, was involved in activation of ATM-Chk1-Cdc25C DNA damage response, and G2–M phase arrest. Neddylation inhibition profoundly inhibited hepatic metastasis in UM.

Here, we show that EGFR mutation-mediated enhancement of glycolysis is critical for EGFR stability. EGFR knockdown significantly decreased levels of glycolytic pathway intermediates via transcriptional regulation of glycolytic genes. EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis was required for fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a critical component of EGFR stability. Nonsustained ATP production enhanced reactive oxygen species accumulation and subsequent JNK-mediated activation of autophagy, which in turn induced EGFR degradation. Our data show that EGFR-mutant NSCLCs require EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis to maintain EGFR stability. This pathway may serve as an attractive therapeutic target for EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Significance: Enhanced glycolysis by EGFR mutation is required for maintaining EGFR levels via inhibition of JNK-induced autophagy.

Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with various types of cancer including glioma. Here, we show that high level expression of NDRG1 in tumors significantly correlated with better prognosis of patients with GBM. Loss of NDRG1 in GBM cells upregulated GSK3β levels and promoted cell proliferation, which was reversed by selective inhibitors of GSK3β. In contrast, NDRG1 overexpression suppressed growth of GBM cells by decreasing GSK3β levels via proteasomal degradation and by suppressing AKT and S6 cell growth signaling, as well as cell-cycle signaling pathways. Conversely, GSK3β phosphorylated serine and threonine sites in the C-terminal domain of NDRG1 and limited the protein stability of NDRG1. Furthermore, treatment with differentiation inducing factor-1, a small molecule derived from Dictyostelium discoideum, enhanced NDRG1 expression, decreased GSK3β expression, and exerted marked NDRG1-dependent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which NDRG1 inhibits GBM proliferation and progression. Our study thus identifies the NDRG1/GSK3β signaling pathway as a key growth regulatory program in GBM, and suggests enhancing NDRG1 expression in GBM as a potent strategy toward the development of anti-GBM therapeutics. Significance: This study identifies NDRG1 as a potent and endogenous suppressor of glioblastoma cell growth, suggesting the clinical benefits of NDRG1-targeted therapeutics against glioblastoma.","2020-01-15","2021-09-14 06:38:02","2021-09-14 06:38:04","2021-09-14 06:38:02","234-248","","2","80","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","cancerres-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Molecular Cell Biology PMID: 31723002","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FLNIRAAJ/Ito et al. - 2020 - Bidirectional Regulation between NDRG1 and GSK3β C.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDRIKCEG/234.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31723002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1−XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1−XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-κB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.","2018-07-24","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","1-16","","8","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LB5TWTM/Jeong et al. - 2018 - XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IV83MPKV/s41419-018-0867-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-14 06:42:27","2021-09-14 06:42:29","2021-09-14 06:42:27","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6EU67MUE/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we found that a subgroup of multiple myeloma cell lines (e.g., RPMI-8226, MM.1S, KMS-12BM) and about half of the primary myeloma samples tested are sensitized to TNF-induced cell death by MLN4924. This correlated with MLN4924-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced activation of the classical NFκB pathway and reduced the efficacy of TNF-induced TNFR1 signaling complex formation. Interestingly, binding studies revealed a straightforward correlation between cell surface TNFR1 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines and their sensitivity for MLN4924/TNF-induced cell death. The cell surface expression levels of TNFR1 in the investigated MM cell lines largely correlated with TNFR1 mRNA expression. This suggests that the variable levels of cell surface expression of TNFR1 in myeloma cell lines are decisive for TNF/MLN4924 sensitivity. Indeed, introduction of TNFR1 into TNFR1-negative TNF/MLN4924-resistant KMS-11BM cells, was sufficient to sensitize this cell line for TNF/MLN4924-induced cell death.

However, continued requirement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and speciﬁc small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting b-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/b-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation–driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufﬁcient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that b-catenin–dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efﬁcacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.

WA was found to inhibit proliferation by inducing a dose-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and promoting cell death through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This was accompanied by an inhibitory shift in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway which included diminished expression and/or phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and p85 S6K with increased activation of AMPKα and the tumor suppressor tuberin/TSC2. Alterations in proteins of the MAPK pathway and cell surface receptors like EGFR, Her2/ErbB2, and c-Met were also observed. WA induced an N-acetyl-L-cysteinerepressible enhancement in cellular oxidative potential/stress with subsequent induction of a heat shock stress response primarily through HSP70, HSP32, and HSP27 upregulation and HSF1 downregulation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the responses to RITA remain enigmatic. Several groups reported the induction of a p53-dependent DNA damage response. Furthermore, the existence of a p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint has been suggested, involving the checkpoint kinase Chk1. We have recently shown synergistic induction of apoptosis by RITA in combination with Nutlin-3, and we observed concomitant Chk2 phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated whether Chk2 contributes to the cellular responses to RITA. Strikingly, the induction of apoptosis seemed entirely Chk2 dependent. Transcriptional activity of p53 in response to RITA required the presence of Chk2. A partial rescue of apoptosis observed in Noxa knockdown cells emphasized the relevance of p53 transcriptional activity for RITA-induced apoptosis. In addition, we observed an early p53- and Chk2-dependent block of DNA replication upon RITA treatment. Replicating cells seemed more prone to entering RITA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the RITA-induced DNA damage response, which was not a secondary effect of apoptosis induction, was strongly attenuated in cells lacking p53 or Chk2.

Here we report that phosphorylation of Sin1 at Thr 86 and Thr 398 suppresses mTORC2 kinase activity by dissociating Sin1 from mTORC2. Importantly, Sin1 phosphorylation, triggered by S6K or Akt, in a cellular context-dependent manner, inhibits not only insulin- or IGF-1-mediated, but also PDGF- or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2, demonstrating a negative regulation of mTORC2 independent of IRS-1 and Grb10. Finally, a cancer-patient-derived Sin1-R81T mutation impairs Sin1 phosphorylation, leading to hyper-activation of mTORC2 by bypassing this negative regulation. Together, our results reveal a Sin1-phosphorylation-dependent mTORC2 regulation, providing a potential molecular mechanism by which mutations in the mTORC1–S6K–Sin1 signalling axis might cause aberrant hyper-activation of the mTORC2–Akt pathway, which facilitates tumorigenesis.","2013-11","2021-09-14 06:47:42","2021-09-14 06:47:44","2021-09-14 06:47:42","1340-1350","","11","15","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 11 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Cell signalling;Growth factor signalling;TOR signalling Subject_term_id: cancer;cell-signalling;growth-signalling;tor-signalling","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BXDRTPGQ/Liu et al. - 2013 - Sin1 phosphorylation impairs mTORC2 complex integr.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RYPBUWIM/ncb2860.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas arginine activates mTORC1, it is overridden by high expression of cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1). Because cancer cells often encounter low levels of nutrients, an alternative mechanism might exist to regulate CASTOR1 expression. Here we show K29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of CASTOR1 by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF167. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylates CASTOR1 at S14, significantly increasing its binding to RNF167, and hence its ubiquitination and degradation, while simultaneously decreasing its affinity to MIOS, leading to mTORC1 activation. Therefore, AKT activates mTORC1 through both TSC2- and CASTOR1-dependent pathways. Several cell types with high CASTOR1 expression are insensitive to arginine regulation.

Through governing the ubiquitination and degradation of numerous key regulators, β-TrCP1/2 regulates various cellular physiological and pathological processes. However, whether and how these two proteins cross talk and whether they regulate cell autophagy and proliferation in different manners is completely unknown. Herein, we report that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are the physiological substrates of SCF E3 ligase and target each other for degradation that is dependent on their β-TrCP degron sequences. Furthermore, glucose deprivation activates AMPK kinase to phosphorylate β-TrCP1 and promotes the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of β-TrCP1 by β-TrCP2, but does not promote β-TrCP2 degradation by β-TrCP1. Finally, we found that β-TrCP2, not β-TrCP1, preferentially degrades DEPTOR and REDD1, the inhibitors of mTORC1, to activate mTORC1, leading to autophagy inhibition and cell growth. Thus, our study demonstrates that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 mutually target each other for degradation and that β-TrCP2 acts as a dominant paralog in the regulation of cell autophagy and growth, which might be a promising anticancer target.","2020-03","2021-09-14 06:58:33","2021-09-14 06:58:34","2021-09-14 06:58:33","1119-1133","","3","27","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 3 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Macroautophagy;Oncogenes;Ubiquitin ligases Subject_term_id: macroautophagy;oncogenes;ubiquitin-ligases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D3D6FY5B/Cui et al. - 2020 - The cross talk of two family members of β-TrCP in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1. Deep sequencing of LARP1-bound mRNAs reveal that non-phosphorylated LARP1 interacts with both 5’ and 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs and inhibits their translation. Importantly, phosphorylation of LARP1 by mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1 dissociates it from 5’UTRs and relieves its inhibitory activity on RP mRNA translation. Concomitantly, phosphorylated LARP1 scaffolds mTORC1 on the 3’UTRs of translationally-competent RP mRNAs to facilitate mTORC1-dependent induction of translation initiation.

However, whether AMPK activation itself is sufficient to block cancer cell growth remains to be determined. A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone.

ULK1, one of the key elements of autophagy activator complex, together with the two sensors of nutrient and energy conditions, called mTORC1 and AMPK kinases, guarantee the precise function of cell response mechanism. We claim that the feedback loops of AMPK–mTORC1–ULK1 regulatory triangle determine an accurate dynamical characteristic of autophagic process upon cellular stress. By using both molecular and theoretical biological techniques, here we reveal that a delayed negative feedback loop between active AMPK and ULK1 is essential to manage a proper cellular answer after prolonged starvation or rapamycin addition. AMPK kinase quickly gets induced followed by AMPK-P-dependent ULK1 activation, whereas active ULK1 has a rapid negative effect on AMPK-P resulting in a delayed inhibition of ULK1. The AMPK-P → ULK1 ˧ AMPK-P negative feedback loop results in a periodic repeat of their activation and inactivation and an oscillatory activation of autophagy, as well. We demonstrate that the periodic induction of self-cannibalism is necessary for the proper dynamical behaviour of the control network when mTORC1 is inhibited with respect to various stress events. By computational simulations we also suggest various scenario to introduce “delay” on AMPK-P-dependent ULK1 activation (i.e. extra regulatory element in the wiring diagram or multi-phosphorylation of ULK1).","2020-10-20","2021-09-14 07:34:18","2021-09-14 07:34:25","2021-09-14 07:34:18","17803","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell biology;Systems biology Subject_term_id: cell-biology;systems-biology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RYRYGI45/Holczer et al. - 2020 - Fine-tuning of AMPK–ULK1–mTORC1 regulatory triangl.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AL2YCFHU/s41598-020-75030-8.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for glycolysis stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib's anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling. These results support the potential clinical utility of using PFKFB3 inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs to manage NSCLC.</p>","2019-07-05","2021-09-14 07:36:13","2021-09-14 07:36:15","2021-09-14 07:36:13","10530-10543","","27","294","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 31126985","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/24BZKJ3G/Lypova et al. - 2019 - Increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-2,6-bi.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I7HJG8EK/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether AMPK activation itself is sufficient to block cancer cell growth remains to be determined. A small molecule screening was performed and identified MT 63?78, a specific and potent direct AMPK activator. Here, we show that direct activation of AMPK inhibits PCa cell growth in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa (CRPC) models, induces mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. In vivo, AMPK activation is sufficient to reduce PCa growth, whereas the allelic loss of its catalytic subunits fosters PCa development. Importantly, despite mTORC1 blockade, the suppression of de novo lipogenesis is the underpinning mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated PCa growth inhibition, suggesting AMPK as a therapeutic target especially for lipogenesis-driven PCas. Finally, we demonstrate that MT 63?78 enhances the growth inhibitory effect of AR signaling inhibitors MDV3100 and abiraterone.

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 07:46:58","2021-09-14 07:47:00","2021-09-14 07:46:58","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZE9XUU2K/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HEVGFZPX/S0944711319302284.html","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo.

Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate several elements downstream of type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (InsR). However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR regulates IGF-IR and InsR themselves. Here we show that mTOR possesses unexpected tyrosine kinase activity and activates IGF-IR/InsR. Rapamycin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IGF-IR/InsR, which is largely dependent on rictor and mTOR. Moreover, mTORC2 promotes ligand-induced activation of IGF-IR/InsR. IGF- and insulin-induced IGF-IR/InsR phosphorylation is significantly compromised in rictor-null cells. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) directly interacts with SIN1 thereby recruiting mTORC2 to IGF-IR/InsR and promoting rapamycin- or ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR/InsR. mTOR exhibits tyrosine kinase activity towards the general tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) and IGF-IR/InsR. Both recombinant mTOR and immunoprecipitated mTORC2 phosphorylate IGF-IR and InsR on Tyr1131/1136 and Tyr1146/1151, respectively. These effects are independent of the intrinsic kinase activity of IGF-IR/InsR, as determined by assays on kinase-dead IGF-IR/InsR mutants. While both rictor and mTOR immunoprecitates from rictor+/+ MCF-10A cells exhibit tyrosine kinase activity towards IGF-IR and InsR, mTOR immunoprecipitates from rictor−/− MCF-10A cells do not induce IGF-IR and InsR phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-deficient mutation of residue Tyr1131 in IGF-IR or Tyr1146 in InsR abrogates the activation of IGF-IR/InsR by mTOR. Finally, overexpression of rictor promotes IGF-induced cell proliferation. Our work identifies mTOR as a dual-specificity kinase and clarifies how mTORC2 promotes IGF-IR/InsR activation.","2016-01","2021-09-14 07:48:44","2021-09-14 07:48:45","2021-09-14 07:48:44","46-65","","1","26","","Cell Res","","","","","","","","en","2016 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Enzyme mechanisms;Kinases;Phosphorylation Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;enzyme-mechanisms;kinases;phosphorylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FFQ5LL7H/Yin et al. - 2016 - mTORC2 promotes type I insulin-like growth factor .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have reported previously that TGF-β1 induces the selective up-regulation of mitochondrial Nox4, playing critical roles in podocyte apoptosis. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Nox4 up-regulation by mTORC1 activation on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in immortalized podocytes. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Blocking TGF-β receptor I with SB431542 completely blunted the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. Transient adenoviral overexpression of mTOR-WT and constitutively active mTORΔ augmented TGF-β1-treated Nox4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis, whereas mTOR kinase-dead suppressed the above changes. In addition, knockdown of mTOR mimicked the effect of mTOR-KD. Inhibition of mTORC1 by low-dose rapamycin or knockdown of p70S6K protected podocytes through attenuation of Nox4 expression and subsequent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by TGF-β1. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade, but not the PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway, abolished TGF-β1-induced mTOR activation. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 or mTORC1 did not reduce the TGF-β1-stimulated increase in Nox4 mRNA level but significantly inhibited total Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, double knockdown of Smad2 and 3 or only Smad4 completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2-mTORactivation. Our data suggest that TGF-β1 increases translation of Nox4 through the Smad-ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis, which is independent of transcriptional regulation. Activation of this pathway plays a crucial role in ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to podocyte apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic and preventive target in proteinuric and chronic kidney diseases.</p>","2015-12-25","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","2021-09-14 07:51:00","30830-30842","","52","290","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IL954EFQ/Das et al. - 2015 - Transforming Growth Factor β1-induced Apoptosis in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results here show that in response to a regimen of high fat or high glucose diets, Mstn levels were induced in muscle and liver of mice. High glucose- or fat- mediated induction of Mstn was controlled at the level of transcription, as highly conserved carbohydrate response and sterol-responsive (E-box) elements were present in the <i>Mstn</i> promoter and were revealed to be critical for ChREBP (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein) or SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) regulation of <i>Mstn</i> expression. Further molecular analysis suggested that the increased Mstn levels (due to high glucose or fatty acid loading) resulted in increased expression of <i>Cblb</i> in a Smad3-dependent manner. Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cblb) is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that has been shown to specifically degrade insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein. Consistent with this, our results revealed that elevated Mstn levels specifically up-regulated Cblb, resulting in enhanced ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS1. In addition, over expression or knock down of <i>Cblb</i> had a major impact on IRS1 and pAkt levels in the presence or absence of insulin. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that increased glucose levels and high fat diet, both, result in increased circulatory Mstn levels.

Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance.

However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition. These discoveries reveal a more nuanced understanding of PI3K isoform dependency and unveil novel strategies to selectively target PI3K signaling nodes in a context-specific manner.","2021-08-20","2021-09-23 19:22:44","2021-09-23 19:22:47","2021-09-23 19:22:44","5053","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Prostate cancer;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: prostate-cancer;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7TD659DF/Mao et al. - 2021 - Defining the therapeutic selective dependencies fo.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WNWWHYEZ/s41467-021-25341-9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanistically, we identified ATXN3 as a Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal localization is blocked by active Rag heterodimer in response to amino acid stimulation. Consistently, cells lacking functional Rag heterodimer on the lysosome accumulate Ub-Rheb, and blockade of its degradation instigates robust lysosomal mTORC1 localization and its activation without the Ragulator-Rag system.

Here we show that the acetylation of the C-terminal region (CTR) of S6K1 blocks mTORC1-dependent Thr-389 phosphorylation, an essential phosphorylation site for S6K1 activity. The acetylation of the CTR of S6K1 is inhibited by the class III histone deacetylases, SIRT1 and SIRT2. An S6K1 mutant lacking acetylation sites in its CTR shows enhanced Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity, whereas the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant exhibits decreased Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity. Interestingly, relative to the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant, the acetylation-defective mutant displays higher affinity toward Raptor, an essential scaffolding component of mTORC1 that recruits mTORC1 substrates.

Here we assessed mLST8 loss in a panel of normal and cancer cells and observed little to no impact on assembly or activity of mTORC1. However, mLST8 loss blocked mTOR association with mTORC2 cofactors RICTOR and SIN1, thus abrogating mTORC2 activity. Similarly, a single pair of mutations on mLST8 with a corresponding mutation on mTOR interfered with mTORC2 assembly and activity without affecting mTORC1. We also discovered a direct interaction between mLST8 and the NH2-terminal domain of the mTORC2 cofactor SIN1. In PTEN-null prostate cancer xenografts, mLST8 mutations disrupting the mTOR interaction motif inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation and decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the scaffolding function of mLST8 is critical for assembly and activity of mTORC2, but not mTORC1, an observation that could enable therapeutic mTORC2-selective inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Significance: These findings show that mLST8 functions as a scaffold to maintain mTORC2 integrity and kinase activity, unveiling a new avenue for development of mTORC2-specific inhibitors.","2019-07-01","2021-09-23 20:47:43","2021-09-23 20:47:43","2021-09-23 20:47:43","3178-3184","","13","79","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","cancerres-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Priority Reports PMID: 31085701","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XHEPNLS8/Hwang et al. - 2019 - Disruption of the Scaffolding Function of mLST8 Se.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/S8SP92MW/3178.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085701","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated a strategy to improve efficacy of PI3K-α inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) in TNBC. While BYL719 is effective at inhibiting cell proliferation in T47D, a triple positive cell line, it had limited activity in TNBC. This may be partially due to persistent phosphorylation of RB, and incomplete inhibition of p-S6 in TNBC, since the inhibitory effect of BYL719 on p-RB and p-S6 was significantly reduced in TNBC compared to T47D cells. Addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 to BYL719 caused a simultaneous reduction of p-RB and p-S6, and a more complete inhibition of p-S6, leading to decreased expression of the pro-survival protein MCL-1, an induction of apoptosis, and an enhanced reduction of tumor growth in a PDX model of TNBC.

In this study, we show that NF-κB is activated by the two most common PI3K mutations, PIK3CA E545K and H1047R. We found that markers of NF-κB are most strongly upregulated under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Gene expression analysis conducted on cells deprived of growth factors identified the repertoire of genes altered by oncogenic PI3K mutations following growth factor deprivation. This gene set most closely correlated with gene signatures from claudin-low and basal-like breast tumors, subtypes frequently exhibiting constitutive PI3K/Akt activity. An NF-κB–dependent subset of genes driven by oncogenic PI3K mutations was also identified that encoded primarily secreted proteins, suggesting a paracrine role for this gene set. Interestingly, while NF-κB activated by oncogenes such as Ras and EGF receptor leads to cell-autonomous effects, abrogating NF-κB in PI3K-transformed cells did not decrease proliferation or induce apoptosis. However, conditioned media from PI3K mutant-expressing cells led to increased STAT3 activation in recipient THP-1 monocytes or normal epithelial cells in a NF-κB and interleukin-6–dependent manner. Together, our findings describe a PI3K-driven, NF-κB–dependent transcriptional profile that may play a critical role in promoting a microenvironment amenable to tumor progression. These data also indicate that NF-κB plays diverse roles downstream from different oncogenic signaling pathways.

Here we find that hemizygous deletion of the PIK3R1 gene encoding p85α is a frequent event in breast cancer, with PIK3R1 expression significantly reduced in breast tumors. PIK3R1 knockdown transforms human mammary epithelial cells, and genetic ablation of Pik3r1 accelerates a mouse model of HER2/neu-driven breast cancer. We demonstrate that partial loss of p85α increases the amount of p110α–p85 heterodimers bound to active receptors, augmenting PI3K signaling and oncogenic transformation.

Together, our data suggest that p85α plays a tumor-suppressive role in transformation, and suggest that p110α-selective therapeutics may be effective in the treatment of breast cancer patients with PIK3R1 loss.","2017-07-03","2021-09-23 21:03:32","2021-09-23 21:03:32","2021-09-23 21:03:32","7095-7100","","27","114","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","©  . http://www.pnas.org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/misc/userlicense.xhtml","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","ISBN: 9781704706115 Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 28630349","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CFQGJX9N/Thorpe et al. - 2017 - PI3K-p110α mediates the oncogenic activity induced.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630349","","breast cancer; p85; PI3K; targeted therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experience with other successful targeted agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may reduce the durability of clinical benefit. Here, we sought to understand mechanisms underlying resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient cancers. We generated cell lines resistant to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 from parental PTEN-null breast cancer cell lines and identified a novel PIK3CB D1067Y mutation in both cell lines that was recurrent in cancer patients. Stable expression of mutant PIK3CB variants conferred resistance to PI3K inhibition that could be overcome by downstream AKT or mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that the p110β D1067Y mutant was highly activated and induced PIP3 levels at the cell membrane, subsequently promoting the localization and activation of AKT and PDK1 at the membrane and driving PI3K signaling to a level that could withstand treatment with proximal inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the PIK3CB D1067Y mutant behaved as an oncogene and transformed normal cells, an activity that was enhanced by PTEN depletion. Collectively, these novel preclinical and clinical findings implicate the acquisition of activating PIK3CB D1067 mutations as an important event underlying the resistance of cancer cells to selective PI3K inhibitors.

Surprisingly, AMPK is also activated by growth factor EGF through Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinase and is essential for EGF-mediated Akt activation and biological functions. AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes. Finally, targeting AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to anti-EGF receptor targeted therapy.

Flow cytometric analysis showed that FC101 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the cells. Concurrently, FC101 downregulated protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), and Cdc25A, and upregulated expression of the CDK inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1), resulting in hypophosphorylation of Rb.

Ubiquitin signaling plays a critical role in coordinating protein recruitment during the DNA damage response. Here, we find that the microRNA biogenesis factor DGCR8 promotes tumor resistance to X-ray radiation independently of its Drosha-binding ability. Upon radiation, the kinase ATM and the deubiquitinase USP51 mediate the activation and stabilization of DGCR8 through phosphorylation and deubiquitination. Specifically, radiation-induced ATM-dependent phosphorylation of DGCR8 at serine 677 facilitates USP51 to bind, deubiquitinate, and stabilize DGCR8, which leads to the recruitment of DGCR8 and DGCR8’s binding partner RNF168 to MDC1 and RNF8 at DSBs. This, in turn, promotes ubiquitination of histone H2A, repair of DSBs, and radioresistance. Altogether, these findings reveal the non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DSB repair and suggest that radiation treatment may result in therapy-induced tumor radioresistance through ATM- and USP51-mediated activation and upregulation of DGCR8.","2021-06-29","2021-07-01 03:15:39","2021-07-02 20:14:09","2021-07-01 03:15:39","4033","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Double-strand DNA breaks;Radiotherapy;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: double-strand-dna-breaks;radiotherapy;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J6GH323Z/Hang et al. - 2021 - Non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DNA double-stra.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DMS96PUV/s41467-021-24298-z.html","","Houston; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these limitations, we designed a series of compounds that selectively inhibit mTORC1 and not mTORC2. These ‘bi-steric inhibitors’ comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. Structural modification of these components modulated their affinities for their binding sites on mTOR and the selectivity of the bi-steric compound. mTORC1-selective compounds potently inhibited 4EBP1 phosphorylation and caused regressions of breast cancer xenografts. Inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation was sufficient to block cancer cell growth and was necessary for maximal antitumor activity. At mTORC1-selective doses, these compounds do not alter glucose tolerance, nor do they relieve AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of HER3. Thus, in preclinical models, selective inhibitors of mTORC1 potently inhibit tumor growth while causing less toxicity and receptor reactivation as compared to pan-mTOR inhibitors.","2021-06-24","2021-07-01 03:17:23","2021-09-07 20:59:20","2021-07-01 03:17:23","1-10","","","","","Nat Chem Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Cell signalling;Kinases;Medicinal chemistry;Small molecules Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;cell-signalling;kinases;medicinal-chemistry;small-molecules","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DQF3EMXY/Lee et al. - 2021 - Selective inhibitors of mTORC1 activate 4EBP1 and .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KRFHQR59/s41589-021-00813-7.html","","Extreme; New York; California; _company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alterations in dosage of DYRK1A leads to defects in neurogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation, and may increase the risk of certain cancers. DYRK1A localizes to a number of subcellular structures including vesicles where it is known to phosphorylate a number of proteins and regulate vesicle biology. However, the mechanism by which it translocates to vesicles is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of TRAF2, an E3 ligase, as an interaction partner of DYRK1A. Our data suggest that TRAF2 binds to PVQE motif residing in between the PEST and histidine repeat domain (HRD) of DYRK1A protein, and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A. This results in translocation of DYRK1A to the vesicle membrane. DYRK1A increases phosphorylation of Sprouty 2 on vesicles, leading to the inhibition of EGFR degradation, and depletion of TRAF2 expression accelerates EGFR degradation. Further, silencing of DYRK1A inhibits the growth of glioma cells mediated by TRAF2.

After subcutaneous engraftment, agnospheres recapitulate the CUP phenotype, by spontaneously and quickly disseminating, and forming widespread established metastases. Regardless of different genetic backgrounds, agnospheres invariably display cell-autonomous proliferation and self-renewal, mostly relying on unrestrained activation of the MAP kinase/MYC axis, which confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.

Here we employ an unbiased kinome-wide siRNA screen to reveal that HER3, is essential for the proliferation of most HNSCC cells that do not harbor PIK3CA mutations. Indeed, we find that persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 and PI3K recruitment underlies aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in PIK3CA wild type HNSCCs. Remarkably, antibody-mediated HER3 blockade exerts a potent anti-tumor effect by suppressing HER3-PI3K-AKT-mTOR oncogenic signaling and concomitantly reversing the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.

Herein, we utilize HER2 transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME2) to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo response and recurrence upon T-DM1 treatment. Continuous in vitro dosing of HME2 cells with T-DM1 failed to produce a spontaneously resistant cell line. However, induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via pretreatment with TGF-β1 was capable of promoting emergence of T-DM1-resistant (TDM1R) cells. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that induction of EMT decreased trastuzumab binding, prior to overt loss of HER2 expression in TDM1R cells. Kinome analyses of TDM1R cells indicated increased phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB4, and FGFR1. TDM1R cells failed to respond to the ErbB kinase inhibitors lapatinib and afatinib, but they acquired sensitivity to FIIN4, a covalent FGFR kinase inhibitor. In vivo, minimal residual disease (MRD) remained detectable via bioluminescent imaging following T-DM1-induced tumor regression. Upon cessation of the ADC, relapse occurred and secondary tumors were resistant to additional rounds of T-DM1. These recurrent tumors could be inhibited by FIIN4. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of FGFR1 was sufficient to enhance tumor growth, diminish trastuzumab binding, and promote recurrence following T-DM1-induced MRD. Finally, patient-derived xenografts from a HER2+ breast cancer patient who had progressed on trastuzumab failed to respond to T-DM1, but tumor growth was significantly inhibited by FIIN4. Overall, our studies strongly support therapeutic combination of TDM1 with FGFR-targeted agents in HER2+ breast cancer.","2021-01-21","2021-07-01 03:46:44","2021-07-02 22:31:05","2021-07-01 03:46:44","1-11","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer models;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Receptor pharmacology;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-models;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;receptor-pharmacology;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FMM9AVAE/Akhand et al. - 2021 - Fibroblast growth factor receptor facilitates recu.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/C24SW33M/s41523-020-00213-5.html","","Low; Indiana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sensitive monitoring platform for cancer-associated miRNA (oncomiR) action is needed for mechanistic studies, preclinical evaluation, and inhibitor screening. In this study, we developed and systemically applied a sensitive and efficient lentivirus-based system for monitoring oncomiR actions, essentially miR-21. The specificity and sensitivity of “miRDREL” against various oncomiRs were validated by checking for tight correlations between their expression and targeting efficacy. Experiments based on the transfection of synthetic mimics and antagomir-mediated depletion of oncomiRs further confirmed the specificity of the system. Systemic application of miRDRELs to natural oncomiR targets, knockdown of key microprocessors, and physiological triggering of oncomiRs also demonstrated that the system is an effective tool for monitoring cellular oncomiR action. Importantly, molecular modeling-based screening confirmed the action of the miR-21-targeting drug ivermectin and led to the identification of a new effective derivative, GW4064, for inhibiting oncogenic DDX23-miR-21 signaling. Furthermore, proteomic-kinase inhibitor screenings identified a novel oncogenic kinome-DDX23-miR-21 axis and thus expands our understanding of miR-21 targeting therapeutics in tumorigenesis.

Mechanically, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AL354740.1-204 (also named as NUDT3-AS4) acts as a microRNA sponge to compete with AKT1/mTOR mRNAs for binding to miR-99s, leading to decrease in degradation of AKT1/mTOR mRNAs and subsequent increase in AKT1/mTOR protein expression. Inhibition of lncRNA-NUDT3-AS4 and suppression of the NUDT3-AS4/miR-99s association contribute to Comp34-affected biologic pathways. In addition, Comp34 alone is effective in cells with secondary resistance to rapamycin, the best-known inhibitor of mTOR, and displays a greater in vivo antitumor efficacy and lower toxicity than rapamycin in TNBC xenografted models.

PAK4 knockout induces adhesion protein re-expression in ECs, reduces vascular abnormalities, improves T cell infiltration and inhibits GBM growth in mice. Moreover, PAK4 inhibition normalizes the tumor vascular microenvironment and sensitizes GBM to chimeric antigen receptor–T cell immunotherapy. Finally, we reveal a MEF2D/ZEB1- and SLUG-mediated mechanism by which PAK4 reprograms the EC transcriptome and downregulates claudin-14 and VCAM-1 expression, enhancing vessel permeability and reducing T cell adhesion to the endothelium.

While enhancing CHIP functionality has broad therapeutic potential, prior efforts have all relied on genetic upregulation. Here we report that CHIP-mediated protein turnover is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation at S20 (mouse, S19 human). This increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein half-life, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. PKG-mediated CHIP-pS20 or expressing CHIP-S20E (phosphomimetic) reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A amplifies both. In vivo, depressing PKG activity lowers CHIP-S20 phosphorylation and protein, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been canonically used in NSCLC treatment. However, prevalent innate and acquired resistances and EGFR kinase-independent pro-survival properties limit the clinical efficacy of EGFR TKIs. Therefore, the discovery of novel EGFR degraders is a promising approach towards improving therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. Here, we identified a 23-hydroxybetulinic acid derivative, namely DPBA, as a novel EGFR small-molecule ligand. It exerted potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in both EGFR wild type and mutant NSCLC by degrading EGFR. Mechanistic studies disclosed that DPBA binds to the EGFR extracellular domain at sites differing from those of EGF and EGFR. DPBA did not induce EGFR dimerization, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, but it significantly promoted EGFR degradation and repressed downstream survival pathways. Further analyses showed that DPBA induced clathrin-independent EGFR endocytosis mediated by flotillin-dependent lipid rafts and unaffected by EGFR TKIs. Activation of the early and late endosome markers rab5 and rab7 but not the recycling endosome marker rab11 was involved in DPBA-induced EGFR lysosomal degradation. The present study offers a new EGFR ligand for EGFR pharmacological degradation and proposes it as a potential treatment for EGFR-positive NSCLC, particularly NSCLC with innate or acquired EGFR TKI resistance. DPBA can also serve as a chemical probe in the studies on EGFR trafficking and degradation.","2020-10-09","2021-07-01 04:01:11","2021-07-02 19:59:18","2021-07-01 04:01:11","1-13","","1","5","","Sig Transduct Target Ther","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Drug development;Lung cancer Subject_term_id: drug-development;lung-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UAJSCJLV/Yao et al. - 2020 - Discovery of a novel EGFR ligand DPBA that degrade.pdf","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we used Phos-tag SDS-PAGE to investigate N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation of SFKs and their non-N-myristoylated G2A mutants. The serine-13 residue of Lyn (Lyn-S13) was shown to be N-myristoylation-dependently phosphorylated. Although there have been more than 40 reports of mass spectrometric studies on phosphorylation at Lyn-S13, the kinase responsible remained unclear. We succeeded in identifying casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells co-expressing Lyn and CK1γ, the phosphorylation level of Lyn-S13 increased significantly. CK1γ is unique among the CK1 family (α, γ, δ, and ε) in carrying an S-palmitoylation site for membrane binding. Co-expression with the non-S-palmitoylated CK1γ mutant, which localized in the cytosol, gave no increase in the phosphorylation level at Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells expressing the non-S-palmitoylated Lyn-C3A mutant, on the other hand, the Lyn-C3A mutant was phosphorylated at Lyn-S13, and the mutant remained at the Golgi.

Oncogenic BRAFV600E signals as an active monomer in the absence of active RAS, however, in many tumors BRAF dimers mediate ERK signaling. FDA-approved RAF inhibitors poorly inhibit BRAF dimers, which leads to tumor resistance. We found that Ponatinib, an FDA-approved drug, is an effective inhibitor of BRAF monomers and dimers. Ponatinib binds the BRAF dimer and stabilizes a distinct αC-helix conformation through interaction with a previously unrevealed allosteric site. Using these structural insights, we developed PHI1, a BRAF inhibitor that fully uncovers the allosteric site. PHI1 exhibits discrete cellular selectivity for BRAF dimers, with enhanced inhibition of the second protomer when the first protomer is occupied, comprising a novel class of dimer selective inhibitors.

Here, anticancer activity and mechanism of action was investigated for the first time using a human prostate cancer (PCa) model. MomC was active in all PCa cell lines at low micromolar concentrations and induced an unusual caspase-independent, non-apoptotic cell death. Kinase activity screening identified activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK1/2) to be one of the primary molecular mechanism of MomC anticancer activity. Functional assays demonstrated a specific and selective JNK1/2 activation prior to the induction of other cell death related processes. Inhibition of JNK1/2 by pretreatment with the JNK-inhibitor SP600125 antagonized cytotoxic activity of the marine compound. MomC caused an upregulation of cytotoxic ROS. However, in contrast to other ROS-inducing agents, co-treatment with PARP-inhibitor olaparib revealed antagonistic effects indicating an active PARP to be necessary for MomC activity. Interestingly, although no direct regulation of p38 and ERK1/2 were detected, active p38 kinase was required for MomC efficacy, while the inhibition of ERK1/2 increased its cytotoxicity. In conclusion, MomC shows promising activity against PCa, which is exerted via JNK1/2 activation and non-apoptotic cell death.","2020-08-06","2021-07-01 04:04:06","2021-07-02 22:24:47","2021-07-01 04:04:06","13178","","1","10","","Sci Rep","Marine alkaloid monanchoxymycalin C","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Marine biology;Marine chemistry Subject_term_id: marine-biology;marine-chemistry","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UGMY3RPW/Dyshlovoy et al. - 2020 - Marine alkaloid monanchoxymycalin C a new specifi.pdf","","Germany; Low","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This mutation is introduced in the endogenous FES gene of HL-60 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Leveraging the temporal and acute control offered by our strategy, we show that FES activity is dispensable for differentiation of HL-60 cells towards macrophages.

The induction of senescence may represent a strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when combined with a second drug that selectively eliminates senescent cancer cells (senolysis)4,5. Here, using a kinome-focused genetic screen, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-replication kinase CDC7 induces senescence selectively in liver cancer cells with mutations in TP53. A follow-up chemical screen identified the antidepressant sertraline as an agent that kills hepatocellular carcinoma cells that have been rendered senescent by inhibition of CDC7. Sertraline suppressed mTOR signalling, and selective drugs that target this pathway were highly effective in causing the apoptotic cell death of hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with a CDC7 inhibitor. The feedback reactivation of mTOR signalling after its inhibition6 is blocked in cells that have been treated with a CDC7 inhibitor, which leads to the sustained inhibition of mTOR and cell death. Using multiple in vivo mouse models of liver cancer, we show that treatment with combined inhibition of of CDC7 and mTOR results in a marked reduction of tumour growth.

Upregulation of SPAK-dependent CCC phosphorylation has been implicated in several neurological diseases. Using a scaffold-hybrid strategy, we develop a novel potent and selective SPAK inhibitor, 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (“ZT-1a”). ZT-1a inhibits NKCC1 and stimulates KCCs by decreasing their SPAK-dependent phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a decreases inflammation-induced CCC phosphorylation in the choroid plexus and reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion in a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a reduces ischemia-induced CCC phosphorylation, attenuates cerebral edema, protects against brain damage, and improves outcomes in a model of stroke.

Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the survival of 336 GBM patients, demonstrating that under standard treatment, which includes TMZ, EGFRvIII expression is associated with prolonged survival, but only in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumors. Using isogenic GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII expression we could demonstrate that EGFRvIII increases TMZ sensitivity and results in enhanced numbers of DNA double-strand breaks and a pronounced S/G2-phase arrest after TMZ treatment. We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII.

Escalating dose-response experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 µM). In vivo, while AZD2014 and dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy exceeds that of either drug. Co-targeting the mTOR and EPH receptor pathways with these or similar compounds may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for VS, a condition for which there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.","2020-03-06","2021-07-01 04:13:19","2021-07-02 19:26:07","2021-07-01 04:13:19","4211","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Pharmacology;Tumour-suppressor proteins Subject_term_id: pharmacology;tumour-suppressor-proteins","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/796A23XJ/Sagers et al. - 2020 - Combination therapy with mTOR kinase inhibitor and.pdf","","Medium; Boston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of ‘classical’ oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M–checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition.","2020-06","2021-07-01 04:15:56","2021-07-02 22:37:36","2021-07-01 04:15:56","4781-4797","","25","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 25 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer models Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-models","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KG54F83U/Pancholi et al. - 2020 - Tumour kinome re-wiring governs resistance to palb.pdf","","Low; UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment.","2020-05","2021-07-01 04:17:08","2021-07-02 19:53:21","2021-07-01 04:17:08","3939-3951","","19","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 19 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer immunotherapy;Prostate cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-immunotherapy;prostate-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9BJLG6SC/Liu et al. - 2020 - p300CBP inhibition enhances the efficacy of progr.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HSRTAID7/s41388-020-1270-z.html","","High; Kentucky","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 causes Phelan-McDermid syndrome and autism, whereas duplication of the same gene leads to SHANK3 duplication syndrome, a disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric phenotypes including hyperactivity and bipolar disorder as well as epilepsy. We recently demonstrated the functional modularity of Shank3, which suggests that normalizing levels of Shank3 itself might be more fruitful than correcting pathways that function downstream of it for treatment of disorders caused by alterations in SHANK3 dosage. To identify upstream regulators of Shank3 abundance, we performed a kinome-wide siRNA screen and identified multiple kinases that potentially regulate Shank3 protein stability. Interestingly, we discovered that several kinases in the MEK/ERK2 pathway destabilize Shank3 and that genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of ERK2 increases Shank3 abundance in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that ERK2 binds Shank3 and phosphorylates it at three residues to promote its poly-ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Altogether, our findings uncover a druggable pathway as a potential therapeutic target for disorders with reduced SHANK3 dosage, provide a rich resource for studying Shank3 regulation, and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for identifying regulators of dosage-sensitive genes.","2020-10","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2021-07-02 19:01:45","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2504-2516","","10","25","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","en","2019 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 10 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Autism spectrum disorders;Biotechnology;Genetics Subject_term_id: autism-spectrum-disorders;biotechnology;genetics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4BL2SRTC/Wang et al. - 2020 - A kinome-wide RNAi screen identifies ERK2 as a dru.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4Y5AW72W/s41380-018-0325-9.html","","Medium; Houston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, its amino-terminal region binds FLASH, an RDH-specific 3′-end processing factor, which keeps the kinase on the chromatin. CDK11 phosphorylates serine 2 (Ser2) of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is initiated when RNAPII reaches the middle of RDH genes and is required for further RNAPII elongation and 3′-end processing. CDK11 depletion leads to decreased number of cells in S phase, likely owing to the function of CDK11 in RDH gene expression. Thus, the reliance of RDH expression on CDK11 could explain why CDK11 is essential for the growth of many cancers.","2020-05","2021-07-01 04:29:49","2021-07-02 19:19:00","2021-07-01 04:29:49","500-510","","5","27","","Nat Struct Mol Biol","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Transcription Subject_term_id: kinases;transcription","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q6D8NPL9/Gajdušková et al. - 2020 - CDK11 is required for transcription of replication.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EKQXK57R/s41594-020-0406-8.html","","Low; Czeck Republic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of VCP ATPase activity, we show that VCP stabilizes Beclin-1 levels by promoting the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 towards Beclin-1. VCP also regulates the assembly and activity of the Beclin-1-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex I, thus regulating the production of PI(3)P, a key signaling lipid responsible for the recruitment of downstream autophagy factors. A decreased level of VCP, or inhibition of its ATPase activity, impairs starvation-induced production of PI(3)P and limits downstream recruitment of WIPI2, ATG16L and LC3, thereby decreasing autophagosome formation, illustrating an important role for VCP in early autophagy initiation.","2021-04","2021-07-01 04:32:03","2021-07-02 19:52:19","2021-07-01 04:32:03","448-455","","4","17","","Nat Chem Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Kinases;Membrane trafficking;Small molecules Subject_term_id: cell-death;kinases;membrane-trafficking;small-molecules","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/564GYEJR/Hill et al. - 2021 - VCPp97 regulates Beclin-1-dependent autophagy ini.pdf","","High; UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction with Cyclin A and associated factors is identified as a signature of β-herpesvirus kinases. Cyclin A is recruited via RXL motifs that overlap with nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the non-catalytic N termini. This architecture is conserved in HHV6, HHV7 and rodent cytomegaloviruses. Cyclin A binding competes with NLS function, enabling dynamic changes in CHPK localization and substrate phosphorylation. The cytomegalovirus kinase M97 sequesters Cyclin A in the cytosol, which is essential for viral inhibition of cellular replication.

Assessing the impact of rapamycin on the brain proteome and phosphoproteome of Ndufs4 KO mice, we find that rapamycin restores mitochondrial protein levels, inhibits signalling through both mTOR complexes and reduces the abundance and activity of multiple PKC isoforms.

Using a nuclear targeted Akt Substrate-based Tandem Occupancy Peptide Sponge (Akt-STOPS) that we developed for specific inhibition of Akt, a critical upstream kinase, we show that growth factor-stimulated nuclear mTORC1 activity requires nuclear Akt activity. Further mechanistic dissection suggests that nuclear Akt activity mediates growth factor-induced nuclear translocation of Raptor, a regulatory scaffolding component in mTORC1, and localization of Raptor to the nucleus results in nuclear mTORC1 activity in the absence of growth factor stimulation.

We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates. Structures of MAPK-TAD complexes and mechanistic modeling of ATF2 TAD phosphorylation in cells suggest that kinase binding motifs and phosphorylation sites line up to maximize MAPK based co-regulation.

Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes.

One degrader induced rapid, durable and highly specific degradation of AURORA-A. In addition, we found that the degrader complex was stabilized by cooperative binding between AURORA-A and CEREBLON. Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication.

Cardiac-specific deletion of PKBα/β or a high fat diet inhibits insulin-induced phosphorylation of SPEG and SERCA2a, prolongs SR re-uptake of calcium, and impairs cardiac function. Mice bearing a Speg3A mutation to prevent its phosphorylation by PKB display cardiac dysfunction. Importantly, the Speg3A mutation impairs SERCA2a phosphorylation and calcium re-uptake into the SR.

Shortened mitosis causes tumorigenic aneuploidy, but it is unclear whether it also activates the apoptotic machinery2. Separase, a cysteine protease and trigger of all eukaryotic anaphases, has a caspase-like catalytic domain but has not previously been associated with cell death3,4. Here we show that human cells that enter mitosis with already active separase rapidly undergo death in mitosis owing to direct cleavage of anti-apoptotic MCL1 and BCL-XL by separase. Cleavage not only prevents MCL1 and BCL-XL from sequestering pro-apoptotic BAK, but also converts them into active promoters of death in mitosis. Our data strongly suggest that the deadliest cleavage fragment, the C-terminal half of MCL1, forms BAK/BAX-like pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. MCL1 and BCL-XL are turned into separase substrates only upon phosphorylation by NEK2A. Early mitotic degradation of this kinase is therefore crucial for preventing apoptosis upon scheduled activation of separase in metaphase. Speeding up mitosis by abrogation of the spindle assembly checkpoint results in a temporal overlap of the enzymatic activities of NEK2A and separase and consequently in cell death. We propose that NEK2A and separase jointly check on spindle assembly checkpoint integrity and eliminate cells that are prone to chromosome missegregation owing to accelerated progression through early mitosis.","2020-04","2021-07-01 04:38:58","2021-07-02 19:43:07","2021-07-01 04:38:58","542-547","","7804","580","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7804 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Checkpoints;Kinases;Mitosis;Proteases Subject_term_id: apoptosis;checkpoints;kinases;mitosis;proteases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YHJRRCMG/Hellmuth and Stemmann - 2020 - Separase-triggered apoptosis enforces minimal leng.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QPYN9QKL/s41586-020-2187-y.html","","Germany; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). These results demonstrate that in response to CDDP ICLs, TFAs promote p53-dependent apoptosis through the enhancement of the Nox-RIP1-ASK1-MAPK pathway activation, providing insight into the diverse pathogenetic mechanisms of TFAs according to the types of DNA damage.","2021-05-14","2021-07-01 04:40:51","2021-07-02 19:48:36","2021-07-01 04:40:51","10350","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Cell signalling;Kinases;Lipids;Risk factors Subject_term_id: cell-death;cell-signalling;kinases;lipids;risk-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RQSP6E9K/Hirata et al. - 2021 - trans -Fatty acids promote p53-dependent apoptosis.pdf","","High; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues. Cells from these mice show normal STAT phosphorylation in response to JAK3 dependent cytokines but are resistant to the effects of covalent JAK3 inhibitors.

On the other hand, systemic SHOC2 ablation in adult mice is relatively well tolerated. Furthermore, we show that SHOC2 deletion selectively sensitizes KRAS- and EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, SHOC2 deletion prevents MEKi-induced RAF dimerization, leading to more potent and durable ERK pathway suppression that promotes BIM-dependent apoptosis.

STRIPAK also serves as a master regulator for the STE20 family kinases. Following serum or lysophosphatidic acid stimulation, active RhoA binds and dissociates rhophilin and NF2/Kibra from STRIPAK, thereby inducing the association and dephosphorylation of MST1/2 and MAP4Ks by the STRIPAK phosphatase catalytic subunit PP2AC. Rhophilin suppresses cancer cell growth by activating the Hippo pathway.

The DRS is a conserved region that lies distal to the active site and mediates ERK–protein interactions. We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo. BI-78D3 does not covalently modify p38MAPK, JNK or ERK5. BI-78D3 promotes apoptosis in BRAF inhibitor-naive and resistant melanoma cells containing a BRAF V600E mutation.

Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2).

Binding to a proline-tyrosine motif in the Akt-PH domain, SAV1 suppresses Akt activation by blocking Akt’s movement to plasma membrane. We further identify cancer-associated SAV1 mutations with impaired ability to bind Akt, leading to Akt hyperactivation. We also determine that MERTK phosphorylates Akt1-Y26, releasing SAV1 binding and allowing Akt responsiveness to canonical PI-3K pathway activation.

Genetic loss of the Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in ULK1 that disrupt the binding of Cu reduced ULK1/2-dependent signalling and the formation of autophagosome complexes. Increased levels of intracellular Cu are associated with starvation-induced autophagy and are sufficient to enhance ULK1 kinase activity and, in turn, autophagic flux. The growth and survival of lung tumours driven by KRASG12D is diminished in the absence of Ctr1, is dependent on ULK1 Cu binding and is associated with reduced levels of autophagy and signalling.

Mass spectrometry revealed that AKT target activity was altered in GCBCs compared with naive B cells. Retargeting was linked to differential AKT T308 and S473 phosphorylation, in turn controlled by GC-specific upregulation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 and the phosphatase PTEN. In GCBCs, AKT preferentially targeted CSK, SHP-1 and HPK1, which are negative regulators of BCR signaling.

Using protein microarrays, we identify Cyclin Y as an AMPK substrate that is phosphorylated at Serine 326 (S326) both in vitro and in cells. Phosphorylation of Cyclin Y at S326 promotes its interaction with the Cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), thereby stimulating its catalytic activity.

Ligand-induced monoubiquitination and endosomal puncta of BIK1 exhibit spatial and temporal dynamics that are distinct from those of the PRR FLS2.

Timely dephosphorylation of 53BP1 is critical for genome integrity, as premature recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA lesions impairs mitotic fidelity. Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) dephosphorylates 53BP1 in late mitosis to allow its recruitment to DNA lesions in G1. How cells appropriately dephosphorylate 53BP1, thereby restoring DDR, is unclear. Here, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of kinetic control of 53BP1 dephosphorylation in mitosis. We demonstrate that CDK5, a kinase primarily functional in post-mitotic neurons, is active in late mitotic phases in non-neuronal cells and directly phosphorylates PP4R3β, the PP4 regulatory subunit that recognizes 53BP1. Specific inhibition of CDK5 in mitosis abrogates PP4R3β phosphorylation and abolishes its recognition and dephosphorylation of 53BP1, ultimately preventing the localization of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin.

SREBPs are inhibited by a complex composed of INSIG proteins, SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and sterols in the endoplasmic reticulum. Regulation of the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP by sterol levels is critical for the dissociation of the SCAP–SREBP complex from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of SREBPs1,2. However, whether this protein interaction is regulated by a mechanism other than the abundance of sterol—and in particular, whether oncogenic signalling has a role—is unclear. Here we show that activated AKT in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells phosphorylates cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, at Ser90. Phosphorylated PCK1 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it uses GTP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151. This phosphorylation reduces the binding of sterols to INSIG1 and INSIG2 and disrupts the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP, leading to the translocation of the SCAP–SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus, the activation of SREBP proteins (SREBP1 or SREBP2) and the transcription of downstream lipogenesis-related genes, proliferation of tumour cells, and tumorigenesis in mice.

Key players of M-phase entry are the opposing Cdk1 kinase and PP2A-B55δ phosphatase. In Xenopus, the protein Arpp19, phosphorylated at serine 67 by Greatwall, plays an essential role in inhibiting PP2A-B55δ, promoting Cdk1 activation. Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block. Hence, PP2A-B55δ acts critically on Arpp19 on two distinct sites, opposing PKA and Greatwall to orchestrate the prophase release and M-phase entry.","2021-03-23","2021-07-01 05:46:28","2021-07-02 22:12:02","2021-07-01 05:46:28","1837","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Meiosis;Oogenesis;Phosphorylation;Xenopus Subject_term_id: kinases;meiosis;oogenesis;phosphorylation;xenopus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YVH88A76/Lemonnier et al. - 2021 - The M-phase regulatory phosphatase PP2A-B55δ oppos.pdf","","Paris; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we rescue neonatal lethality in RagAGTP mice and find morphometric and metabolic alterations that span glucose, lipid, ketone, bile acid and amino acid homeostasis in adults, and a median lifespan of nine months. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of livers from RagAGTP mice reveal a failed metabolic adaptation to fasting due to a global impairment in PPARα transcriptional program. These metabolic defects are partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and revert by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. Constitutive hepatic nutrient signaling does not cause hepatocellular damage and carcinomas, unlike genetic activation of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1.

Finally, in NSCLC patients, pH3 levels are increased after progression on EGFR TKIs and high pH3 baseline correlates with shorter survival.

FBXW2 overexpression reduces β-catenin levels and protein half-life, whereas FBXW2 knockdown increases β-catenin levels, protein half-life and transcriptional activity. Functionally, FBXW2 overexpression inhibits migration and invasion by blocking transactivation of MMPs driven by β-catenin, whereas FXBW2 knockdown promotes migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. In human lung cancer specimens, while FBXW2 levels are inversely correlated with β-catenin levels and lymph-node metastasis, lower FBXW2 coupled with higher β-catenin, predict a worse patient survival.

This role of CMA in genome quality control is exerted through regulated degradation of activated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by this pathway after the genotoxic insult. Nuclear accumulation of Chk1 in CMA-deficient cells compromises cell cycle progression and prolongs the time that DNA damage persists in these cells. Furthermore, blockage of CMA leads to hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of the MRN (Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1) complex, which participates in early steps of particular DNA repair pathways.

How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural. Here, we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full-length version of CENP-C, the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly. We show that full-length CENP-C, a dimer, binds stably to two nucleosomes and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios closely matching those of endogenous human kinetochores.

Here, we study the cross-talk between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras signaling during lacrimal gland budding morphogenesis. Our results show that PI3K is activated by both the p85-mediated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Ras-mediated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. On the other hand, PI3K also promotes extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via a direct interaction with Ras. Both PI3K and ERK are upstream regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and, together, they prevent expansion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region. We further show that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for induction of lacrimal gland buds. These results reveal that the interplay between PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and mTOR mediates the cross-talk among FGF, IGF, and EGF signaling in support of lacrimal gland development.

While Tanc2-null mice show embryonic lethality, Tanc2-haploinsufficient mice survive but display mTORC1/2 hyperactivity accompanying synaptic and behavioral deficits reversed by mTOR-inhibiting rapamycin. Tanc2 interacts with and inhibits mTOR, which is suppressed by mTOR-activating serum or ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant. Tanc2 and Deptor, also known to inhibit mTORC1/2 minimally affecting neurodevelopment, distinctly inhibit mTOR in early- and late-stage neurons.

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo.

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-09-14 06:21:27","2021-09-14 06:21:27","2021-09-14 06:21:27","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TY36U25C/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that this metabolic vulnerability is driven by mTORC1, which promotes resistance to chemotherapy and targeted cancer drugs, but simultaneously suppresses autophagy. We show that autophagy is essential for tumor cells to cope with therapeutic perturbation of metabolism and that mTORC1-mediated suppression of autophagy is required and sufficient for generating a metabolic vulnerability leading to energy crisis and apoptosis.

This defect rendered accumulation of DNA damage in p53 mutant cells upon treatment with deoxyuridine analogues. Notably, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) greatly enhanced this response, whereas normal cells responded with activation of the p53-p21 axis and cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of either p53 or p21/CDKN1A conferred the p53 mutant phenotype.

These tumors express several activated tyrosine kinase receptors, which prompted attempts to treat patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although clinical benefit was observed in phase II clinical trials with imatinib and sorafenib, and sporadically also with EGFR inhibitors, therapies evaluated to date have shown modest activity. With the goal of identifying new drugs with immediate therapeutic potential for chordoma patients, we collected clinically approved drugs and other advanced inhibitors of MET, PDGFRβ, and EGFR tyrosine kinases, and assessed their antiproliferative activity against a panel of chordoma cell lines. Chordoma cell lines were not responsive to MET and PDGFRβ inhibitors. U-CH1 and UM-Chor1 were sensitive to all EGFR inhibitors, whereas the remaining cell lines were generally insensitive to these drugs. Afatinib was the only EGFR inhibitor with activity across the chordoma panel. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the responses observed and found that the antiproliferative IC50s correlate with the unique ability of afatinib to promote degradation of EGFR and brachyury, an embryonic transcription factor considered a key driver of chordoma. Afatinib displayed potent antitumor efficacy in U-CH1, SF8894, CF322, and CF365 chordoma tumor models in vivo. In the panel analyzed, high EGFR phosphorylation and low AXL and STK33 expression correlated with higher sensitivity to afatinib and deserve further investigation as potential biomarkers of response. These data support the use of afatinib in clinical trials and provide the rationale for the upcoming European phase II study on afatinib in advanced chordoma.

In a xenograft model of MKN1 cells, the alpelisib and paclitaxel combination significantly enhanced anti-tumor activity by decreasing Ki-67 expression and increasing apoptosis. Moreover, this combination tended to prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our data suggest promising anti-tumor efficacy of alpelisib alone or in combination with paclitaxel in PIK3CA-mutant GC cells.","2020-07-23","2021-09-14 06:27:11","2021-09-14 06:27:13","2021-09-14 06:27:11","12308","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Molecular medicine Subject_term_id: cancer;molecular-medicine","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UD9RT3EP/Kim et al. - 2020 - PI3K-targeting strategy using alpelisib to enhance.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long-term event-free survival of children with high-risk neuroblastoma is still poor despite the improvements with current multimodality treatment protocols. Activated JAK/STAT3 pathway plays an important role in many human cancers, suggesting that targeting STAT3 is a promising strategy for treating high-risk neuroblastoma. Experimental Design: To evaluate the biologic consequences of specific targeting of STAT3 in neuroblastoma, we assessed the effect of tetracycline (Tet)-inducible STAT3 shRNA and the generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotide AZD9150 which targets STAT3 in three representative neuroblastoma cell line models (AS, NGP, and IMR32). Results: Our data indicated that Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 inhibited endogenous STAT3 and STAT3 target genes. Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 decreased cell growth and tumorigenicity. In vivo, STAT3 inhibition by Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA or AZD9150 alone had little effect on growth of established tumors. However, when treated xenograft tumor cells were reimplanted into mice, there was a significant decrease in secondary tumors in the mice receiving AZD9150-treated tumor cells compared with the mice receiving ntASO-treated tumor cells. This indicates that inhibition of STAT3 decreases the tumor-initiating potential of neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 significantly increased neuroblastoma cell sensitivity to cisplatin and decreased tumor growth and increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Conclusions: Our study supports the development of strategies targeting STAT3 inhibition in combination with conventional chemotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

We seek to evaluate the efficacy and synergistic mechanisms of combinations with a novel SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, to inform their clinical development. Experimental Design: The combinations of TNO155 with EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi), BRAFi, KRASG12Ci, CDK4/6i, and anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody were tested in appropriate cancer models in vitro and in vivo, and their effects on downstream signaling were examined. Results: In EGFR-mutant lung cancer models, combination benefit of TNO155 and the EGFRi nazartinib was observed, coincident with sustained ERK inhibition. In BRAFV600E colorectal cancer models, TNO155 synergized with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors by blocking ERK feedback activation by different RTKs. In KRASG12C cancer cells, TNO155 effectively blocked the feedback activation of wild-type KRAS or other RAS isoforms induced by KRASG12Ci and greatly enhanced efficacy. In addition, TNO155 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib showed combination benefit in a large panel of lung and colorectal cancer patient–derived xenografts, including those with KRAS mutations. Finally, TNO155 effectively inhibited RAS activation by colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is critical for the maturation of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, and showed combination activity with anti–PD-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings suggest TNO155 is an effective agent for blocking both tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive RTK signaling in RTK- and MAPK-driven cancers and their tumor microenvironment.

To treat lung cancer, various anticancer drugs were developed and tested, but they failed because of drug resistance. In the present study, we tested herbal medicines, such as TK and CuD, as anticancer drugs to decrease side effects and resistance. Methods Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. Analysis of cell cycle arrest was performed by flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis by cucurbitacin D was measured by an annexin V-FITC/PI assay. We performed RTK kit analysis. Levels of p-ErbB3, p-STAT3, p-NF-κB, and caspases were measured by western blot analysis. Nuclear staining of ErbB3 was measured by immunocytochemistry. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and NF-κB was detected by STAT3 and NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assays. Results We found a synergistic effect of TK with CDDP and PXD in primary culture of human NSCLC tumor cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced sub-G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced apoptosis, regulated apoptotic molecules, caused morphological changes and inhibited colony formation in H1299 cells. We found that TK suppresses p-ErbB3 expression and signaling. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-AKT, p-Erk, and p-JNK signaling and suppressed Stat3 and NF-κB transcriptional activity in H1299 cells. More importantly, the combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-ErbB3 and downstream molecules in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited ErbB2/ErbB3 dimerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that the synergistic effect of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling. Conclusion The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD decreases cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling in H1299 lung cancer cells. TK or CuD could be useful as a compound to treat lung cancer. Additionally, targeting ErbB3 may also be useful for treating lung cancer.","2020-01-01","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","153109","","","66","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2W66ZDYR/Ku et al. - 2020 - Synergistic anticancer effect of combined use of T.pdf","","","Lung cancer; Cisplatin; Cucurbitacin D; ErbB3; Pemetrexed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, continued requirement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and speciﬁc small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting b-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/b-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation–driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufﬁcient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that b-catenin–dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efﬁcacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.

In this study, we identified several key underlying mechanisms of anticancer action of WA in glioblastoma cells. WA was found to inhibit proliferation by inducing a dose-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and promoting cell death through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This was accompanied by an inhibitory shift in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway which included diminished expression and/or phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and p85 S6K with increased activation of AMPKα and the tumor suppressor tuberin/TSC2. Alterations in proteins of the MAPK pathway and cell surface receptors like EGFR, Her2/ErbB2, and c-Met were also observed. WA induced an N-acetyl-L-cysteinerepressible enhancement in cellular oxidative potential/stress with subsequent induction of a heat shock stress response primarily through HSP70, HSP32, and HSP27 upregulation and HSF1 downregulation.

FBXW2 overexpression reduces β-catenin levels and protein half-life, whereas FBXW2 knockdown increases β-catenin levels, protein half-life and transcriptional activity. Functionally, FBXW2 overexpression inhibits migration and invasion by blocking transactivation of MMPs driven by β-catenin, whereas FXBW2 knockdown promotes migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. In human lung cancer specimens, while FBXW2 levels are inversely correlated with β-catenin levels and lymph-node metastasis, lower FBXW2 coupled with higher β-catenin, predict a worse patient survival.

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 07:46:58","2021-09-14 07:47:00","2021-09-14 07:46:58","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZE9XUU2K/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HEVGFZPX/S0944711319302284.html","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors. Cancer Discov; 4(5); 554–63. ©2014 AACR.

However, the necessary signals that initiate insulin resistance during high calorie intake remain largely unknown. Our results here show that in response to a regimen of high fat or high glucose diets, Mstn levels were induced in muscle and liver of mice. High glucose- or fat- mediated induction of Mstn was controlled at the level of transcription, as highly conserved carbohydrate response and sterol-responsive (E-box) elements were present in the <i>Mstn</i> promoter and were revealed to be critical for ChREBP (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein) or SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) regulation of <i>Mstn</i> expression. Further molecular analysis suggested that the increased Mstn levels (due to high glucose or fatty acid loading) resulted in increased expression of <i>Cblb</i> in a Smad3-dependent manner. Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cblb) is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that has been shown to specifically degrade insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein. Consistent with this, our results revealed that elevated Mstn levels specifically up-regulated Cblb, resulting in enhanced ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS1. In addition, over expression or knock down of <i>Cblb</i> had a major impact on IRS1 and pAkt levels in the presence or absence of insulin. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that increased glucose levels and high fat diet, both, result in increased circulatory Mstn levels. The increased Mstn in turn is a potent inducer of insulin resistance by degrading IRS1 protein via the E3 ligase, Cblb, in a Smad3-dependent manner.</p>","2014-03-14","2021-09-14 07:52:38","2021-09-14 07:52:40","2021-09-14 07:52:38","7654-7670","","11","289","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 24451368","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J5UTP5QR/Bonala et al. - 2014 - Myostatin Induces Insulin Resistance via Casitas B.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451368","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""﻿"Key","Item Type","Publication Year","Author","Title","Publication Title","ISBN","ISSN","DOI","Url","Abstract Note","Date","Date Added","Date Modified","Access Date","Pages","Num Pages","Issue","Volume","Number Of Volumes","Journal Abbreviation","Short Title","Series","Series Number","Series Text","Series Title","Publisher","Place","Language","Rights","Type","Archive","Archive Location","Library Catalog","Call Number","Extra","Notes","File Attachments","Link Attachments","Manual Tags","Automatic Tags","Editor","Series Editor","Translator","Contributor","Attorney Agent","Book Author","Cast Member","Commenter","Composer","Cosponsor","Counsel","Interviewer","Producer","Recipient","Reviewed Author","Scriptwriter","Words By","Guest","Number","Edition","Running Time","Scale","Medium","Artwork Size","Filing Date","Application Number","Assignee","Issuing Authority","Country","Meeting Name","Conference Name","Court","References","Reporter","Legal Status","Priority Numbers","Programming Language","Version","System","Code","Code Number","Section","Session","Committee","History","Legislative Body"

The latter is a Monte-Carlo method, which, despite enjoying broad availability in a large number of existing software packages, is computationally expensive due to the huge amounts of ensemble averaging required for obtaining accurate statistical information. The former is a set of coupled differential-difference equations for the probability of the system being in any one of the possible mesoscopic states; these equations are typically computationally intractable because of the inherently large state space. Here we introduce the software package intrinsic Noise Analyzer (iNA), which allows for systematic analysis of stochastic biochemical kinetics by means of van Kampen’s system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation. iNA is platform independent and supports the popular SBML format natively. The present implementation is the first to adopt a complementary approach that combines state-of-the-art analysis tools using the computer algebra system Ginac with traditional methods of stochastic simulation. iNA integrates two approximation methods based on the system size expansion, the Linear Noise Approximation and effective mesoscopic rate equations, which to-date have not been available to non-expert users, into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. In particular, the present methods allow for quick approximate analysis of timedependent mean concentrations, variances, covariances and correlations coefficients, which typically outperforms stochastic simulations. These analytical tools are complemented by automated multi-core stochastic simulations with direct statistical evaluation and visualization. We showcase iNA’s performance by using it to explore the stochastic properties of cooperative and non-cooperative enzyme kinetics and a gene network associated with circadian rhythms. The software iNA is freely available as executable binaries for Linux, MacOSX and Microsoft Windows, as well as the full source code under an open source license.","2012-06-12","2019-01-31 03:18:30","2019-01-31 03:18:30","2019-01-31 03:18:30","e38518","","6","7","","","Intrinsic Noise Analyzer","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X29BZDNG/Thomas et al. - 2012 - Intrinsic Noise Analyzer A Software Package for t.pdf","","","","Peccoud, Jean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more easily digestible for some audiences.","2010-04-24","2019-01-31 03:18:42","2019-01-31 03:18:42","2019-01-31 03:18:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1004.4280","<p>Comment: 6 pages, no figures</p>","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7CFNY8IA/Wallace - 2010 - A simplified derivation of the Linear Noise Approx.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WZIXLTMQ/1004.html","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most reports of scientific results in the published literature make it difficult for the reader to reproduce the statistical analyses performed in achieving those results because they provide inadequate documentation of the statistical tests and algorithms applied. The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is put forward here as a step towards solving this problem. Results The terms in OBCS including ‘data collection’, ‘data transformation in statistics’, ‘data visualization’, ‘statistical data analysis’, and ‘drawing a conclusion based on data’, cover the major types of statistical processes used in basic biological research and clinical outcome studies. OBCS is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and extends the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), an OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry ontology supported by over 20 research communities. Currently, OBCS comprehends 878 terms, representing 20 BFO classes, 403 OBI classes, 229 OBCS specific classes, and 122 classes imported from ten other OBO ontologies., We discuss two examples illustrating how the ontology is being applied. In the first (biological) use case, we describe how OBCS was applied to represent the high throughput microarray data analysis of immunological transcriptional profiles in human subjects vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. In the second (clinical outcomes) use case, we applied OBCS to represent the processing of electronic health care data to determine the associations between hospital staffing levels and patient mortality. Our case studies were designed to show how OBCS can be used for the consistent representation of statistical analysis pipelines under two different research paradigms. Other ongoing projects using OBCS for statistical data processing are also discussed., The OBCS source code and documentation are available at: https://github.com/obcs/obcs. Conclusions The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics (OBCS) is a community-based open source ontology in the domain of biological and clinical statistics. OBCS is a timely ontology that represents statistics-related terms and their relations in a rigorous fashion, facilitates standard data analysis and integration, and supports reproducible biological and clinical research.","2016-09-14","2019-02-01 21:05:12","2019-02-01 21:05:12","2019-02-01 21:05:12","","","","7","","J Biomed Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27627881 PMCID: PMC5024438","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DH5342KS/Zheng et al. - 2016 - The Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024438/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After all, the untold number of interactions of tens of thousands of genes, a greater number of their products and product derivatives, and tens of thousands of chemicals came much closer to complete characterization. Paradoxically however, while individual efforts produced important biological results, an integrated view of biology from systems perspective seemed ever more distant due to the complexity of data integration from multiple knowledge representation forms, formalisms, modeling paradigms, and conﬂicting scientiﬁc statements. To address this, semantic technologies have risen over the past decade with the promise of truly unifying biological knowledge and allowing cross-domain queries and model integration. In this chapter, we shall examine Semantic Web technologies and their applications to build, publish, query, discover, compare, validate, reason about, and evaluate models and knowledge in Systems Biology. We shall speciﬁcally address biological ontologies, open data repositories, modeling and annotation tools, and selected promising applications of Semantic Systems Biology. We ﬁrmly believe that it shall soon be possible to completely close the gap between facts, models, and results, and to fully apply the accrued models and facts to evaluate biological hypotheses on a system level, discovering meaning within the vast collection of biological knowledge and taking Systems Biology research to a new, unprecedented level.","2013","2019-02-04 02:20:23","2019-02-04 02:20:23","2019-02-04 02:20:23","355-373","","","","","","Semantic Systems Biology","","","","","Springer Netherlands","Dordrecht","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-6803-1_12","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AKF96QYN/Dumontier et al. - 2013 - Semantic Systems Biology Formal Knowledge Represe.pdf","","","","Prokop, Aleš; Csukás, Béla","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ontologies are required to achieve this objective. A few subject-specific ontologies of experiments currently exist. However, despite the unity of scientific experimentation, no general ontology of experiments exists. We propose the ontology EXPO to meet this need. EXPO links the SUMO (the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) with subject-specific ontologies of experiments by formalizing the generic concepts of experimental design, methodology and results representation. EXPO is expressed in the W3C standard ontology language OWL-DL. We demonstrate the utility of EXPO and its ability to describe different experimental domains, by applying it to two experiments: one in high-energy physics and the other in phylogenetics. The use of EXPO made the goals and structure of these experiments more explicit, revealed ambiguities, and highlighted an unexpected similarity. We conclude that, EXPO is of general value in describing experiments and a step towards the formalization of science.","2006-12-22","2019-02-04 20:25:25","2019-02-04 20:25:25","2019-02-04 20:25:25","795-803","","11","3","","J R Soc Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 17015305 PMCID: PMC1885356","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9WK2JSQP/Soldatova and King - 2006 - An ontology of scientific experiments.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1885356/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a pressing technological need for the better representation of biomedical protocols to enable other agents (human or machine) to better reproduce results. A framework that ensures that all information required for the replication of experimental protocols is essential to achieve reproducibility. Methods We have developed the ontology EXACT2 (EXperimental ACTions) that is designed to capture the full semantics of biomedical protocols required for their reproducibility., To construct EXACT2 we manually inspected hundreds of published and commercial biomedical protocols from several areas of biomedicine. After establishing a clear pattern for extracting the required information we utilized text-mining tools to translate the protocols into a machine amenable format. We have verified the utility of EXACT2 through the successful processing of previously 'unseen' (not used for the construction of EXACT2) protocols. Results The paper reports on a fundamentally new version EXACT2 that supports the semantically-defined representation of biomedical protocols. The ability of EXACT2 to capture the semantics of biomedical procedures was verified through a text mining use case. In this EXACT2 is used as a reference model for text mining tools to identify terms pertinent to experimental actions, and their properties, in biomedical protocols expressed in natural language. An EXACT2-based framework for the translation of biomedical protocols to a machine amenable format is proposed. Conclusions The EXACT2 ontology is sufficient to record, in a machine processable form, the essential information about biomedical protocols. EXACT2 defines explicit semantics of experimental actions, and can be used by various computer applications. It can serve as a reference model for for the translation of biomedical protocols in natural language into a semantically-defined format.","2014-11-27","2019-02-04 21:15:24","2019-02-04 21:15:24","2019-02-04 21:15:24","S5","","Suppl 14","15","","BMC Bioinformatics","EXACT2","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25472549 PMCID: PMC4255744","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U9HFFBJ6/Soldatova et al. - 2014 - EXACT2 the semantics of biomedical protocols.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255744/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments.

The cells were injured only when the external medium was frozen and then only when the temperature was -10° or below. Survival dropped abruptly between -10° and -30° regardless of whether the cells were suspended in water or 0.1 M solutions of KH2PO4, NaCl, or CaC12. The critical temperature range of -10° to -30O was unrelated to the temperatures at which the suspending fluids completely solidified, these temperatures being -0.3°, -11°, -30°, and -71° for the four liquids, respectively. Survival at -30° or below was greatly affected by the rate at which the cells were cooled or warmed, with higher survivals being obtained with slow cooling and with rapid warming. Length of exposure at -30° was not a factor; injury was inflicted within 1 minute. The results are interpreted as indicating that death is a result of intracellular ice formation.

We also discuss the challenges and prospects for modelling the effects of genetic changes on physiology and the concept of an integrated platform.","2011-12","2019-03-12 22:41:32","2019-03-12 22:41:32","2019-03-12 22:41:32","821-832","","12","12","","","Software for systems biology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","<p><strong>Data-management and data-analysis tools.</strong></p> <p>broadly classified as:</p> <ul> <li>spreadsheet based</li> <li>Web-based</li> <li>Laboratory information management systems (LIMS)</li> </ul> <p>More recently, online wiki-based document and project management has become a popular mode of exchange for different laboratories, and these formats now provide security and privacy options for data pro‑ tection.

"HYP2KP5B","journalArticle","","Rackauckas, Chris","An Intuitive Introduction For Understanding and Solving Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations","","","","","","Stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) are a generalization of deterministic diﬀerential equations that incorporate a “noise term”. These equations can be useful in many applications where we assume that there are deterministic changes combined with noisy ﬂuctuations. Ito’s Calculus is the mathematics for handling such equations. In this article we introduce stochastic diﬀerential equations and Ito’s calculus from an intuitive point of view, building the ideas from relatable probability theory and only straying into measure-theoretic probability (deﬁning all concepts along the way) as necessary. All of the proofs are discussed intuitively and rigorously: step by step proofs are provided. . We start by reviewing the relevant probability needed in order to develop the stochastic processes. We then develop the mathematics of stochastic processes in order to deﬁne the Poisson Counter Process. We then deﬁne Brownian Motion, or the Wiener Process, as a limit of the Poisson Counter Process. By doing the deﬁnition in this manner, we are able to solve for many of the major properties and theorems of the stochastic calculus without resorting to measure-theoretic approaches. Along the way, examples are given to show how the calculus is actually used to solve problems. After developing Ito’s calculus for solving SDEs, we brieﬂy discuss how these SDEs can be computationally simulated in case the analytical solutions are diﬃcult or impossible. After this, we turn to deﬁning some relevant terms in measure-theoretic probability in order to develop ideas such as conditional expectation and martingales. The conclusion to this article is a set of four applications. We show how the rules of the stochastic calculus and some basic martingale theory can be applied to solve problems such as option pricing, genetic drift, stochastic control, and stochastic ﬁltering. The end of this article is a cheat sheet that details the fundamental rules for “doing” Ito’s calculus, like one would ﬁnd on the cover ﬂap of a calculus book. These are the equations/properties/rules that one rules to solve stochastic diﬀerential equations that are explained and justiﬁed in the article but put together for convenience.","","2019-03-13 02:54:29","2019-03-13 02:54:29","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q7TS6A5K/Rackauckas - An Intuitive Introduction For Understanding and So.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) could be a promising cell source for nerve tissue engineering because they are easily accessible and their use has no ethical issues. We investigated the phenotypic, molecular and functional characteristics of WJMSCs differentiated along a Schwann-cell lineage. Cultured WJMSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord, and the undifferentiated WJMSCs were conﬁrmed by the detection of MSC-speciﬁc cell-surface markers. WJMSCs treated with a mixture of glial growth factors (basic ﬁbroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and forskolin) adopted a spindle-like morphology similar to SCs. Immunocytochemical staining, RT-PCR analysis, and Western blot analysis revealed that the treated cells expressed the glial markers glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein, p75, S100 and P0 and indicative of differentiation. On co-culture with dorsal root ganglia neurons, the differentiated WJMSCs enhanced the number of sprouting neurites and neurite length in dorsal root ganglia neurons. Furthermore, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and RT-PCR methodology, we found differentiated WJMSCs secrete and express neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). Quantiﬁcation of neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells grown in differentiated WJMSCs-conditioned media demonstrates that the neurite length is significantly more than control medium and undifferentiated WJMSCs group.

To potentiate their possible trophic effect, hMSCs were induced without genetic modification to adopt characteristics of Schwann cells (SCs), which provide trophic support for regenerating axons. The induced hMSCs (shMSCs) adopted a SC-like morphology and expressed SC-specific proteins including the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which correlated with cell-cycle exit. In addition, shMSCs secreted higher amounts of several growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) when compared with uninduced hMSCs. Coculture of shMSCs with Neuro2A cells significantly increased neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation but decreased cell death. Transplantation of shMSCs in an ex vivo model of spinal cord injury dramatically enhanced axonal outgrowth, which was mediated by HGF and VEGF secretion and also decreased cell death. These results demonstrate that shMSCs could serve as an endogenous source of neurotrophic growth factors to facilitate axonal regeneration while at the same time protecting the resident cells at the site of tissue injury.

Here, we performed differentiation of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) into SC-like cells (T-MSC-SCs), to evaluate T-MSC-SCs as an alternative to SCs. Using SC markers such as CAD19, GFAP, MBP, NGFR, S100B, and KROX20 during quantitative real-time PCR we detected the upregulation of NGFR, S100B, and KROX20 and the downregulation of CAD19 and MBP at the fully differentiated stage. Furthermore, we found myelination of axons when differentiated SCs were cocultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. The application of T-MSC-SCs to a mouse model of sciatic nerve injury produced marked improvements in gait and promoted regeneration of damaged nerves.

Thus, alternative cell systems for the generation of Schwann cells are desired. Schwann-like cell induced from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) may be one of the ideal alternative cell systems for Schwann cell generation. Although co-culture with Schwann cells or chemicals combined with a mixture of glial growth factors are often utilized for Schwann cell-like differentiation of ADSCs, these methods are usually complicated or expensive. In this experiment, the rat sciatic nerve was cut, and then soaked in culture medium for two days. The treated culture medium was used as an induction agent after ﬁltering. The obtained ADSCs were incubated with the above induction culture medium for ﬁve days. Then, expression of the typical Schwann cell markers, S-100 and GFAP proteins was determined by immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting. The results showed that almost all of the treated ADSCs displayed a spindle shape like morphology after being incubated with induction culture medium for 24 h and expressed S-100 and GFAP proteins after ﬁve days. All of these characteristics of differentiated rat ADSCs were similar to genuine Schwann cells. Thus, this new method, which utilized trophic factors secreted from sciatic nerve leachate, was capable of inducing ADSC differentiation into Schwann-like cell.","2013-09","2019-03-14 06:23:37","2019-03-14 06:23:37","2019-03-14 06:23:37","79-83","","","551","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7NZACL2J/Liu et al. - 2013 - A new method for Schwann-like cell differentiation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess this potential, we compared HUCPVCs to the “gold standard” bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) with respect to their proliferation, differentiation, and transfection capacities. HUCPVCs showed a higher proliferative potential than BMSCs and were capable of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation. Interestingly, osteogenic differentiation of HUCPVCs proceeded more rapidly than BMSCs. Additionally, HUCPVCs expressed higher levels of CD146, a putative MSC marker, relative to BMSCs. HUCPVCs showed comparable transfection efficiency as BMSCs using a nucleofection method but were more amenable to transfection with liposomal methods (FuGENE). Gene array analysis showed that HUCPVCs also expressed Wnt signaling pathway genes that have been implicated in the regulation of MSCs. The similar characteristics between HUCPVCs and MSCs support the applicability of HUCPVCs for cell-based therapies.

However, there is increasing benefit to formalizing the descriptions of protocols, as laboratory automation systems (such as microfluidic chips) are becoming increasingly capable of executing them. Our goal in this paper is to improve both the reproducibility and automation of biology experiments by using a programming language to express the precise series of steps taken. Results We have developed BioCoder, a C++ library that enables biologists to express the exact steps needed to execute a protocol. In addition to being suitable for automation, BioCoder converts the code into a readable, English-language description for use by biologists. We have implemented over 65 protocols in BioCoder; the most complex of these was successfully executed by a biologist in the laboratory using BioCoder as the only reference. We argue that BioCoder exposes and resolves ambiguities in existing protocols, and could provide the software foundations for future automation platforms. BioCoder is freely available for download at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/india/projects/biocoder/. Conclusions BioCoder represents the first practical programming system for standardizing and automating biology protocols. Our vision is to change the way that experimental methods are communicated: rather than publishing a written account of the protocols used, researchers will simply publish the code. Our experience suggests that this practice is tractable and offers many benefits. We invite other researchers to leverage BioCoder to improve the precision and completeness of their protocols, and also to adapt and extend BioCoder to new domains.","2010-11-08","2019-03-26 04:50:42","2019-03-26 04:50:42","2019-03-26 04:50:42","13","","","4","","J Biol Eng","Biocoder","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 21059251 PMCID: PMC2989930","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5EQC9H3X/Ananthanarayanan and Thies - 2010 - Biocoder A programming language for standardizing.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989930/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The syntheses of inorganic materials, however, exist primarily as natural language narratives contained within scientific journal articles. This synthesis information must first be extracted from the text in order to enable analogous synthesis planning methods for inorganic materials. In this work, we present a system for automatically extracting structured representations of synthesis procedures from the texts of materials science journal articles that describe explicit, experimental syntheses of inorganic compounds. We define the structured representation as a set of linked events made up of extracted scientific entities and evaluate two unsupervised approaches for extracting these structures on expert-annotated articles: a strong heuristic baseline and a generative model of procedural text. We also evaluate a variety of supervised models for extracting scientific entities. Our results provide insight into the nature of the data and directions for further work in this exciting new area of research.","2017-11-18","2019-04-27 22:03:19","2019-04-27 22:03:21","2019-04-27 22:03:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1711.06872","Comment: NIPS Workshop on Machine Learning for Molecules and Materials","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MWAREAHN/Mysore et al. - 2017 - Automatically Extracting Action Graphs from Materi.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/986VLZHV/1711.html","","","Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present the Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment (MIFlowCyt) standard, stating the minimum information required to report flow cytometry (FCM) experiments. We brought together a cross-disciplinary international collaborative group of bioinformaticians, computational statisticians, software developers, instrument manufacturers, and clinical and basic research scientists to develop the standard. The standard was subsequently vetted by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) Data Standards Task Force, Standards Committee, membership, and Council. The MIFlowCyt standard includes recommendations about descriptions of the specimens and reagents included in the FCM experiment, the configuration of the instrument used to perform the assays, and the data processing approaches used to interpret the primary output data. MIFlowCyt has been adopted as a standard by ISAC, representing the FCM scientific community including scientists as well as software and hardware manufacturers.

However, research tasks that are not highly standardized are still rarely automated in practice. Two main reasons for this are the substantial investments required to translate molecular biological protocols into robot programs, and the fact that the resulting programs are often too speciﬁc to be easily reused and shared. Recent developments of standardized protocols and dedicated programming languages for liquid-handling operations addressed some aspects of ease-of-use and portability of protocols. However, either they focus on simplicity, at the expense of enabling complex protocols, or they entail detailed programming, with corresponding skills and eﬀorts required from the users. To reconcile these trade-oﬀs, we developed Roboliq, a software system that uses artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods to integrate (i) generic formal, yet intuitive, protocol descriptions, (ii) complete, but usually hidden, programming capabilities, and (iii) user-system interactions to automatically generate executable, optimized robot programs. Roboliq also enables high-level speciﬁcations of complex tasks with conditional execution. To demonstrate the system’s beneﬁts for experiments that are diﬃcult to perform manually because of their complexity, duration, or time-critical nature, we present three proof-of-principle applications for the reproducible, quantitative characterization of GFP variants.","2018-03-16","2019-09-24 04:15:18","2019-09-24 04:15:18","2019-09-24 04:15:18","922-932","","3","7","","ACS Synth.

Despite recent experimental advances, the estimation of unknown parameter values from observed data is still a bottleneck for obtaining accurate simulation results. Many methods exist for parameter estimation in deterministic biochemical systems; methods for discrete stochastic systems are less well developed. Given the probabilistic nature of stochastic biochemical models, a natural approach is to choose parameter values that maximize the probability of the observed data with respect to the unknown parameters, a.k.a. the maximum likelihood parameter estimates (MLEs). MLE computation for all but the simplest models requires the simulation of many system trajectories that are consistent with experimental data. For models with unknown parameters, this presents a computational challenge, as the generation of consistent trajectories can be an extremely rare occurrence. Results: We have developed Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization with Modiﬁed Cross-Entropy Method (MCEM2): an accelerated method for calculating MLEs that combines advances in rare event simulation with a computationally eﬃcient version of the Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Our method requires no prior knowledge regarding parameter values, and it automatically provides a multivariate parameter uncertainty estimate. We applied the method to ﬁve stochastic systems of increasing complexity, progressing from an analytically tractable pure-birth model to a computationally demanding model of yeast-polarization. Our results demonstrate that MCEM2 substantially accelerates MLE computation on all tested models when compared to a stand-alone version of MCEM. Additionally, we show how our method identiﬁes parameter values for certain classes of models more accurately than two recently proposed computationally eﬃcient methods. Conclusions: This work provides a novel, accelerated version of a likelihood-based parameter estimation method that can be readily applied to stochastic biochemical systems. In addition, our results suggest opportunities for added eﬃciency improvements that will further enhance our ability to mechanistically simulate biological processes.","2012","2019-09-26 17:48:14","2019-09-26 17:48:14","2019-09-26 17:48:14","68","","1","13","","BMC Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/84YUMZN3/Daigle et al. - 2012 - Accelerated maximum likelihood parameter estimatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate.","2012-03-05","2019-11-06 03:11:49","2019-11-06 03:11:49","2019-11-06 03:11:49","","","","6","","Front Comput Neurosci","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22403538 PMCID: PMC3293145","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BB939E5T/Hartshorne and Schachner - 2012 - Tracking Replicability as a Method of Post-Publica.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293145/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During recent years there was accepted that algebraic techniques, in particular different kinds of image algebras, is the most prospective direction of construction of the mathematical theory of image analysis and of development an universal algebraic language for representing image analysis transforms and image models. So, the main goal of the Algebraic Approach is designing of a unified scheme for representation of objects under recognition and its transforms in the form of certain algebraic structures. It makes possible to develop corresponding regular structures ready for analysis by algebraic, geometrical and topological techniques. Development of this line of image analysis and pattern recognition is of crucial importance for automated image mining and application problems solving, in particular for diversification classes and types of solvable problems and for essential increasing of solution efficiency and quality.","2016","2019-11-12 21:28:59","2019-11-12 21:28:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CL6NNDPH/Gurevich et al. - 2016 - The Algebraic and Descriptive Approaches and Techn.pdf; ","https://api.semanticscholar.org/6180f9b73e7718e50692bc02d13c7634db2f50b6","","Physical object; Science; Academy; Algorithm; Body Dysmorphic Disorders; cell transformation; Class; Cybernetics; Decision problem; Description; Diversification (finance); HL7PublishingSubSection <operations>; Image analysis; Image processing; Linear algebra; Linguistics; Mathematical morphology; Mathematics; Operand; Pattern recognition; Pattern theory; Prospective search; Requirement; Signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The constructed model involves two-compartment kinetics of the activators IkB (IKK) and NF-kB; the inhibitors A20 and IkBa; and their complexes. In resting cells, the unphosphorylated IkBa binds to NF-kB and sequesters it in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. In response to extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, IKK is transformed from its neutral form (IKKn) into its active form (IKKa), a form capable of phosphorylating IkBa; leading to IkBa degradation. Degradation of IkBa releases the main activator NF-kB; which then enters the nucleus and triggers transcription of the inhibitors and numerous other genes. The newly synthesized IkBa leads NF-kB out of the nucleus and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits IKK converting IKKa into the inactive form (IKKi), a form different from IKKn, no longer capable of phosphorylating IkBa: After parameter ﬁtting, the proposed model is able to properly reproduce time behavior of all variables for which the data are available: NF-kB; cytoplasmic IkBa; A20 and IkBa mRNA transcripts, IKK and IKK catalytic activity in both wild-type and A20-deﬁcient cells. The model allows detailed analysis of kinetics of the involved proteins and their complexes and gives the predictions of the possible responses of whole kinetics to the change in the level of a given activator or inhibitor.","2004-05","2019-12-02 03:51:57","2019-12-02 03:51:58","2019-12-02 03:51:57","195-215","","2","228","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/LFAPNI5E/Lipniacki et al. - 2004 - Mathematical model of NF-κB regulatory module.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following muscle damage, myoblasts proliferate and differentiate in response to temporally-varying inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix cues, which stimulate a shared network of intracellular signaling pathways. Here we present an integrated data-modeling approach to elucidate synergies and antagonisms among proliferation and differentiation signaling axes in myoblasts stimulated by regeneration-associated ligands.MethodsWe treated mouse primary myoblasts in culture with combinations of eight regeneration-associated growth factors and cytokines in mixtures that induced additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects on myoblast proliferation and differentiation responses. For these combinatorial stimuli, we measured the activation dynamics of seven signal transduction pathways using multiplexed phosphoprotein assays and scored proliferation and differentiation responses based on expression of myogenic commitment factors to assemble a cue-signaling-response data compendium. We interrogated the relationship between these signals and responses by partial least-squares (PLS) regression modeling.ResultsPartial least-squares data-modeling accurately predicted response outcomes in cross-validation on the training compendium (cumulative R 2 = 0.96). The PLS model highlighted signaling axes that distinctly govern myoblast proliferation (MEK–ERK, Stat3) and differentiation (JNK) in response to these combinatorial cues, and we confirmed these signal-response associations with small molecule perturbations. Unexpectedly, we observed that a negative feedback circuit involving the phosphatase DUSP6/MKP-3 auto-regulates MEK–ERK signaling in myoblasts.ConclusionThis data-modeling approach identified conflicting signaling axes that underlie muscle progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.","2017-10-01","2019-12-03 05:11:38","2019-12-03 05:11:38","2019-12-03 05:11:38","433-450","","5","10","","Cel.

Quantitative measurements of cell-cycle dynamics in single cells showed that despite variability in G1-, S-, and G2 phases, duration of mitosis is short and remarkably constant. Surprisingly, there is no correlation between cell-cycle length and mitotic duration, suggesting that mitosis is temporally insulated from variability in earlier cell-cycle phases. By combining live cell imaging and computational modeling, we showed that positive feedback is the molecular mechanism underlying the temporal insulation of mitosis. Perturbing positive feedback gave rise to a sluggish, variable entry and progression through mitosis and uncoupled duration of mitosis from variability in cell cycle length. We show that positive feedback is important to keep mitosis short, constant, and temporally insulated and anticipate it might be a commonly used regulatory strategy to create modularity in other biological systems.","2016-10-20","2019-12-03 05:16:56","2019-12-03 05:16:56","2019-12-03 05:16:56","362-375","","2","64","","Molecular Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RIUQWGJ4/Araujo et al. - 2016 - Positive Feedback Keeps Duration of Mitosis Tempor.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FEC55XFB/S1097276516305676.html","","","cell division; mitosis; positive feedback; quantitative biology; temporal control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relative quality of sequencing data and accuracy of genetic variant detection from blood-­derived, saliva-­derived and buccal-d­ erived DNA need to be thoroughly investigated. Methods  Matched blood, saliva and buccal samples from four unrelated individuals were used to compare sequencing metrics and variant-d­ etection accuracy among these DNA sources. Results  We observed significant differences among DNA sources for sequencing quality metrics such as percentage of reads aligned and mean read depth (p<0.05). Differences were negligible in the accuracy of detecting short insertions and deletions; however, the false positive rate for single nucleotide variation detection was slightly higher in some saliva and buccal samples. The sensitivity of copy number variant (CNV) detection was up to 25% higher in blood samples, depending on CNV size and type, and appeared to be worse in saliva and buccal samples with high bacterial concentration. We also show that methylation-b­ ased enrichment for eukaryotic DNA in saliva and buccal samples increased alignment rates but also reduced read-d­ epth uniformity, hampering CNV detection. Conclusion  For WGS, we recommend using DNA extracted from blood rather than saliva or buccal swabs; if saliva or buccal samples are used, we recommend against using methylation-­based eukaryotic DNA enrichment.

CD133 has reproducibly been shown to correlate with disease progression, recurrence, and poor overall survivorship in the malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). Using several patient-derived CD133high and CD133low GBMs we describe intrinsic differences in determinants of stemness, which we owe to a CD133-AKT-Wnt signaling axis in which CD133 functions as a putative cell surface receptor for AKTdependent Wnt activation.

By applying this approach to 24 experimental screens consisting of nearly 400,000 images, we differentiated specific responses from more generalized ones, discovered nuance in the localization behavior of stress-responsive proteins, and formed hypotheses by clustering proteins that have similar patterns. Previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, whereas our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology.           ,              Cells are busy structures in which proteins move from one place to the other to perform their roles. To survive, organisms must constantly adapt to changes, such as mutations, new environments, or encountering drugs. Often, these adaptive responses involve groups of proteins traveling to new locations in the cell. Tracking these movements is useful to understand which biological processes cells activate to cope with modifications.             To study these mechanisms, scientists conduct experiments where they expose cells to one type of change – for example they mutate one gene, or give one drug. They then follow the proteins in the cell using powerful microscopes.             These instruments can take thousands of pictures of cells every day, which results in large amounts of data. The images are then analyzed, which is often subjective, time-consuming or cannot easily be repeated on other experiments. This prevents researchers from considering more than one experiment at the time, and it makes it difficult to compare how cells respond across many different types of changes.             Here, Lu et al. combine and analyze 400,000 images from 24 experiments conducted on yeasts; they use a computational method that automatically measures the differences in the locations of the proteins between experiments. This new large-scale approach reveals aspects of cell biology that are not obvious from the results of any one experiment alone. For example, responses that are specific to one type of change can be distinguished from the ones that occur each time cells are exposed to new conditions. It also becomes possible, for the first time, to group together proteins that move in the same way across different types of changes, and to infer their roles. For instance, a protein was shown to be ‘pulsing’ – moving quickly between two specific compartments in the cell – based on how it shared certain features with other pulsing proteins.             This computational approach is not limited to experiments on yeasts, and could be used on studies in human cells as well. Drug companies could then compare at a large scale how different treatments affect protein localization.","2018-04-05","2019-12-10 04:56:32","2019-12-10 04:56:32","2019-12-10 04:56:32","e31872","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BEUVVLAJ/Lu et al. - 2018 - Integrating images from multiple microscopy screen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate XGA on yeast ABC transporters by engineering 5,353 strains, each deleted for a random subset of 16 transporters, and proﬁling each strain’s resistance to 16 compounds. XGA yielded 85,648 genotype-to-resistance observations, revealing high-order genetic interactions for 13 of the 16 transporters studied.

The identification of any clinically approved drug that could be repurposed to combat COVID-19 would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures to complement social distancing and isolation protocols. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target for drug interventions, based on results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV) an HIV protease inhibitor, that that can inhibit the Mpro of 2002 SARS-CoV. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved anti-retroviral protease inhibitors that may bind more efficiently to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and block its replication. Of high interest is atazanavir (ATV) due to its documented bioavailability within the respiratory tract, which motivated our evaluation on its ability to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication through a series of in vitro experiments. A molecular dynamic analysis showed that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV and occupied the substrate cleft on the active side of the protease throughout the entire molecular dynamic analysis. In a cell-free protease assay, ATV was determined to block Mpro activity at a concentration of 10 μM. Next, a series of assays with in vitro models of virus infection/replications were performed using three cell types, Vero cells, a human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary human monocytes, which confirmed that ATV could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV). In addition, the virus-induced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were reduced in the presence of these drugs, which performed better than chloroquine, a compound recognized for its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.","2020-04-05","2020-04-07 07:21:44","2020-04-07 07:21:44","2020-04-07 07:21:44","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.04.020925","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Q3K4ZWBF/Fintelman-Rodrigues et al. - 2020 - Atazanavir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and pro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remarkably, we summarize here the most relevant theoretical and practical aspects that we have learned for more than 20 years developing and using the miniaturized PFGE systems. We also discussed the theoretical aspects related to DNA migration in PFGE agarose gels. It served as the basis for simulating the DNA electrophoretic patterns in CHEF mini gels and mini-chambers during experimental design and optimization. A critical comparison between standard and miniaturized PFGE systems, as well as the enzymatic and non-enzymatic methods for intact immobilized DNA preparation, is provided throughout the review.

Automatic band detection has been conducted for many years, but only a few incomplete systems have been proposed. Here, we propose a completely automatic band detection system for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) images. The proposed approach mainly comprises lane segmentation and band extraction. In lane segmentation, we characterized the structural features and the spatial distribution of bands in PFGE images to fit pairs of parallel lines. In band extraction, a polynomial fitting method was used to remove the uneven background in a lane; we then used local gradient information to split the stuck bands and extract all bands in every lane. We compared the results with existing semiautomatic methods based on 20 varied PFGE images. The proposed method was shown to be superior to previous methods in most cases; moreover, the proposed approach is a completely automatic processing method.","2015-02-01","2020-11-20 18:14:05","2020-11-20 18:14:05","2020-11-20 18:14:05","145-155","","1","18","","Pattern Anal Applic","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9ZGFVRU2/Tseng and Lee - 2015 - Automatic band detection on pulsed-field gel elect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used genetic and biochemical approaches to compare the responses of IAP-deﬁcient mice and cells to NOD2 stimulation. In all cell types tested, XIAP is the only IAP required for signaling immediately downstream of NOD2, while cIAP1 and cIAP2 are dispensable for NOD2-induced nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. However, mice lacking cIAP1 or TNFR1 have a blunted cytokine response to NOD2 stimulation.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.","","2021-01-11 09:27:59","2021-01-11 09:28:00","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSZHAKWA/Nakamoto - Bitcoin A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The observation that many tumors express EGF receptor (EGFR), yet only a small subset with EGFR-activating mutations respond clinically to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs), suggests that responsive tumors uniquely depend on EGFR signaling for their survival. The nature of this dependence is not understood. Here, we investigate dependence on EGFR signaling by comparing non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines driven by EGFR-activating mutations and genomic amplifications using a global proteomic analysis of phospho-tyrosine signaling. We identify an extensive receptor tyrosine kinase signaling network established in cells expressing mutated and activated EGFR or expressing amplified c-Met. We show that in drug sensitive cells the targeted tyrosine kinase drives other RTKs and an extensive network of downstream signaling that collapse with drug treatment. Comparison of the signaling networks in EGFR and c-Met-dependent cells identify a “core network” of ≈50 proteins that participate in pathways mediating drug response.","2008-01-15","2021-02-10 23:44:14","2021-02-10 23:44:14","2021-02-10 23:44:14","692-697","","2","105","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 18180459","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5Y3U3CKI/Guo et al. - 2008 - Signaling networks assembled by oncogenic EGFR and.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MDL65FWN/692.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180459","","c-Met; EGF receptor; oncogene dependence; proteomics; stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hippo pathway nuclear effectors, Taz/Yap, interact with the TGF-β transcriptional mediators, Smads, to control Smad activity. Key to TGF-β signaling is the nuclear localization of Smads. Thus, to investigate the role of Taz/Yap in Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed mathematical models of Hippo and TGF-β cross talk. The models were based on experimental measurements of TGF-β-induced changes in Taz/Yap and Smad subcellular localization obtained using high-throughput immunofluorescence (IF) imaging in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, EpH4. Bayesian MCMC DREAM parameter estimation was used to quantify the uncertainty in estimates of the kinetic parameters. Variation of the model parameters and statistical analysis show that our modeling predicts that Taz/Yap can alter TGF-β receptor activity and directly or indirectly act as nuclear retention factors.","2020-08-21","2021-02-11 04:32:10","2021-02-11 04:32:10","2021-02-11 04:32:10","101416","","8","23","","iScience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PFEHEISM/Labibi et al. - 2020 - Modeling the Control of TGF-βSmad Nuclear Accumul.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EC6KCQLE/S2589004220306064.html","","","Biological Sciences; Cell Biology; Computational Bioinformatics; Integrative Aspects of Cell Biology; Molecular Network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple effective drug combinations were identified. For example, the combination of ALK and MEK inhibitors was active in an ALK-positive resistant tumor that had developed a MAP2K1 activating mutation, and the combination of EGFR and FGFR inhibitors was active in an EGFR mutant resistant cancer with a novel mutation in FGFR3. Combined ALK and SRC inhibition was effective in several ALK-driven patient-derived models, a result not predicted by genetic analysis alone.

Signals flow through Mst/Lats kinases, which phosphorylate and promote cytoplasmic localization of the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz to inhibit transcription. Here, we identify the multidomain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef7, or ?Pix, as a positive Hippo pathway regulator. We show that ?Pix, which localizes to the cytoplasm, binds both Lats and Yap/Taz and thereby promotes Lats-mediated phosphorylation of Yap/Taz in a GEF-independent manner. ?Pix is required downstream of both cell density sensing and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, and we demonstrate that loss of ?Pix expression in normal mammary epithelial cells strongly reduces Yap/Taz phosphorylation, promotes nuclear localization and increases target gene expression. Conversely, increased expression of ?PIX in breast cancer cell lines re-couples the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz, promoting localization of Yap/Taz to the cytoplasm and inhibiting cell migration and proliferation. These studies thus define ?Pix as a key component that links the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz in response to multiple upstream Hippo pathway activators.","2014-12-17","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2021-03-15 00:54:22","2997-3011","","24","33","","The EMBO Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","www-embopress-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8XWWVUYA/Heidary Arash et al. - 2014 - Arhgef7 promotes activation of the Hippo pathway c.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R2BB6QI2/embj.html","","","Arhgef7; Hippo; Lats; mechanotransduction; Yap/Taz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting RTK-phosphatase interactome reveals a considerable number of previously unidentified interactions and suggests specific roles for different phosphatase families. Additionally, the differential PPIs of some protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and their mutants suggest diverse mechanisms of these PTPs in the regulation of RTK signaling. We further found that PTPRH and PTPRB directly dephosphorylate EGFR and repress its downstream signaling. By contrast, PTPRA plays a dual role in EGFR signaling: besides facilitating EGFR dephosphorylation, it enhances downstream ERK signaling by activating SRC.

Here, we describe MaMTH-DS (mammalian membrane two-hybrid drug screening), a live-cell platform for high-throughput identification of small molecules targeting functional protein–protein interactions of RTKs. We applied MaMTH-DS to an oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant resistant to the latest generation of clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We identified four mutant-specific compounds, including two that would not have been detected by conventional in vitro kinase assays.

This included designing better methods for the successful delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into mammalian cells. While the simplest method for RNAi is the cytosolic delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides, this technique is limited to cells capable of transfection and is primarily utilized during transient in vitro studies. The introduction of shRNA into mammalian cells through infection with viral vectors allows for stable integration of shRNA and long-term knockdown of the targeted gene; however, several challenges exist with the implementation of this technology. Here we describe some well-tested protocols which should increase the chances of successful design, delivery, and assessment of gene knockdown by shRNA. We provide suggestions for designing shRNA targets and controls, a protocol for sequencing through the secondary structure of the shRNA hairpin structure, and protocols for packaging and delivery of shRNA lentiviral particles. Using real-time PCR and functional assays we demonstrate the successful knockdown of ASC, an inflammatory adaptor molecule. These studies demonstrate the practicality of including two shRNAs with different efficacies of knockdown to provide an additional level of control and to verify dose dependency of functional effects. Along with the methods described here, as new techniques and algorithms are designed in the future, shRNA is likely to include further promising application and continue to be a critical component of gene discovery.","2010","2021-03-17 01:16:48","2021-03-17 01:16:48","2021-03-17 01:16:48","139-156","","","","","","Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA)","Methods in Molecular Biology","","","","Humana Press","Totowa, NJ","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-60761-657-3_10","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QBFUGNVN/Taxman et al. - 2010 - Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Design, Delivery, and A.pdf","","","ASC; delivery; design; ELISA; IL-1β; lentivirus; Porphyromonas gingivalis; RNA interference (RNAi); short hairpin RNA (shRNA); small interfering RNA (siRNA); THP1","Sioud, Mouldy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In accordance with the advancement of the technologies for the acquisition of WB signals, a quantitative value is used to present the abundance of target proteins in a complex sample, thereby requiring the use of specific proteins as internal references that represent total proteins. Heretofore, proteins encoded by housekeeping genes such as GAPDH, β-tubulin and β-actin have been commonly used as loading controls without any hesitation because their mRNA expression levels tend to be high and constant in many different cells and tissues. Experimentally, however, some of the housekeeping reference proteins are often displayed with inconsistent expression levels in both homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues, and, in terms of mRNA levels, they have a weak correlation to the abundance of proteins. To estimate accurate, reliable, and reproducible protein quantifications, it is crucial to define appropriate reference controls. For this paper, we explored the recently released large-scale, human proteomic database ProteomicsDB including 16 857 liquid chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry data from 27 human tissues, and suggest 20 ubiquitously- and constitutively-expressed, putative internal-reference controls for the quantification of differential protein expressions. Intriguingly, the most commonly used, known housekeeping genes were entirely excluded in our newly defined candidates. Although the applications of the candidates under many different biological conditions and in other organisms are yet to be empirically verified, we propose reliable, potential loading controls for a WB analysis in this paper.","2016","2021-03-17 20:51:19","2021-03-17 20:51:48","2021-03-17 20:51:19","1863-1867","","13","16","","","State-of-the-art housekeeping proteins for quantitative western blotting","","","","","","","en","© 2016 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These issues can produce spurious results leading to erroneous conclusions. A superior method to protein normalization using housekeeping proteins is Total Protein Normalization, a method now recognized as the gold standard for quantitative westerns. Total Protein Normalization requires that all proteins on a membrane be stained or labeled uniformly, imaged, and then analyzed for total protein. It is important that such a normalization process not interfere with typical immunodetection methods, fits within existing western workflows, and exhibits a linear relationship of signal intensity to protein load under all experimental conditions. Here we report that we developed a new reagent enabling Total Protein Normalization, and we demonstrate its superior protein normalization capabilities through analysis of target proteins in different cell backgrounds. These data illustrate how housekeeping proteins exhibit signal saturation, yield erroneous normalization data, and display sample-to-sample variations averaging 48.2 % overall.

It is our expectation that experimental and computational approaches developed in yeast may eventually be adapted to human systems biology and pharmacology.","2019","2021-03-17 20:57:25","2021-03-17 20:57:27","2021-03-17 20:57:24","495-518","","8","36","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/yea.3395","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8CJ6AU4K/Shellhammer et al. - 2019 - Quantitative analysis of the yeast pheromone pathw.pdf","","","Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; systems biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most situations, blocking with Tween 20 reduces background and/or improves specific signals. Systematical investigation of blocking conditions for fluorescent WB reveals that the autofluorescent background is determined by a combination of multiple factors including the blocker, the excitation/emission configuration, the membrane, and the H2O (wet or dry), varying case by case. The commonly used protein or polymer blockers (milk, bovine serum albumin, fish gelatin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone) each have unique advantages and disadvantages concerning the autofluorescence, the blocking efficiency, and the cost. 0.005%–0.02% sodium dodecyl sulphate can be included to reduce non-specific bands and background caused by non-specific binding of antibodies, however, at the cost of also impairing specific signals.

In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces transient ERK activation that leads to cell proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes sustained ERK activation and cell differentiation. These differences have typically been assumed to reflect distinct feedback mechanisms in the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network, with the receptors themselves acting as simple upstream inputs. We failed to confirm the expected differences in feedback type when investigating transient versus sustained signaling downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and NGF receptor (TrkA). Instead, we found that ERK signaling faithfully followed RTK dynamics when receptor signaling was modulated in different ways. EGFR activation kinetics, and consequently ERK signaling dynamics, were switched from transient to sustained when receptor internalization was inhibited with drugs or mutations, or when cells expressed a chimeric receptor likely to have impaired dimerization. In addition, EGFR and ERK signaling both became more sustained when substoichiometric levels of erlotinib were added to reduce duration of EGFR kinase activation. Our results argue that RTK activation kinetics play a crucial role in determining MAP kinase cascade signaling dynamics and cell fate decisions, and that signaling outcome can be modified by activating a given RTK in different ways.","2020-08-18","2021-04-09 05:23:49","2021-04-09 05:23:49","2021-04-09 05:23:48","eaaz5267","","645","13","","Sci.

Here, we identified an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation site that we termed the TOR interaction motif (TIM; F-x               3               -F-pT), which controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of PKC and Akt and the activity of these kinases. The TIM is invariant in mTORC2-dependent AGC kinases, is evolutionarily conserved, and coevolved with mTORC2 components. Mutation of this motif in Akt1 and PKCβII abolished cellular kinase activity by impairing activation loop and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. mTORC2 directly phosphorylated the PKC TIM in vitro, and this phosphorylation event was detected in mouse brain. Overexpression of PDK1 in mTORC2-deficient cells rescued hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC and Akt by a mechanism dependent on their intrinsic catalytic activity, revealing that mTORC2 facilitates the PDK1 phosphorylation step, which, in turn, enables autophosphorylation. Structural analysis revealed that PKC homodimerization is driven by a TIM-containing helix, and biophysical proximity assays showed that newly synthesized, unphosphorylated PKC dimerizes in cells. Furthermore, disruption of the dimer interface by stapled peptides promoted hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which mTORC2 relieves nascent PKC dimerization through TIM phosphorylation, recruiting PDK1 to phosphorylate the activation loop and triggering intramolecular hydrophobic motif autophosphorylation. Identification of TIM phosphorylation and its role in the regulation of PKC provides the basis for AGC kinase regulation by mTORC2.","2021-04-13","2021-04-14 22:54:20","2021-04-14 22:54:20","2021-04-14 22:54:20","eabe4509","","678","14","","Sci.

Ubiquitin signaling plays a critical role in coordinating protein recruitment during the DNA damage response. Here, we find that the microRNA biogenesis factor DGCR8 promotes tumor resistance to X-ray radiation independently of its Drosha-binding ability. Upon radiation, the kinase ATM and the deubiquitinase USP51 mediate the activation and stabilization of DGCR8 through phosphorylation and deubiquitination. Specifically, radiation-induced ATM-dependent phosphorylation of DGCR8 at serine 677 facilitates USP51 to bind, deubiquitinate, and stabilize DGCR8, which leads to the recruitment of DGCR8 and DGCR8’s binding partner RNF168 to MDC1 and RNF8 at DSBs. This, in turn, promotes ubiquitination of histone H2A, repair of DSBs, and radioresistance. Altogether, these findings reveal the non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DSB repair and suggest that radiation treatment may result in therapy-induced tumor radioresistance through ATM- and USP51-mediated activation and upregulation of DGCR8.","2021-06-29","2021-07-01 03:15:39","2021-07-02 20:14:09","2021-07-01 03:15:39","4033","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Double-strand DNA breaks;Radiotherapy;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: double-strand-dna-breaks;radiotherapy;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J6GH323Z/Hang et al. - 2021 - Non-canonical function of DGCR8 in DNA double-stra.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DMS96PUV/s41467-021-24298-z.html","","Houston; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ‘bi-steric inhibitors’ comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. Structural modification of these components modulated their affinities for their binding sites on mTOR and the selectivity of the bi-steric compound. mTORC1-selective compounds potently inhibited 4EBP1 phosphorylation and caused regressions of breast cancer xenografts. Inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation was sufficient to block cancer cell growth and was necessary for maximal antitumor activity. At mTORC1-selective doses, these compounds do not alter glucose tolerance, nor do they relieve AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of HER3.

Alterations in dosage of DYRK1A leads to defects in neurogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation, and may increase the risk of certain cancers. DYRK1A localizes to a number of subcellular structures including vesicles where it is known to phosphorylate a number of proteins and regulate vesicle biology. However, the mechanism by which it translocates to vesicles is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of TRAF2, an E3 ligase, as an interaction partner of DYRK1A. Our data suggest that TRAF2 binds to PVQE motif residing in between the PEST and histidine repeat domain (HRD) of DYRK1A protein, and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A. This results in translocation of DYRK1A to the vesicle membrane. DYRK1A increases phosphorylation of Sprouty 2 on vesicles, leading to the inhibition of EGFR degradation, and depletion of TRAF2 expression accelerates EGFR degradation. Further, silencing of DYRK1A inhibits the growth of glioma cells mediated by TRAF2. Collectively, these findings suggest that the axis of TRAF2–DYRK1A-Sprouty 2 can be a target for new therapeutic development for EGFR-mediated human pathologies.","2021-06-11","2021-07-01 03:18:39","2021-07-02 22:28:39","2021-07-01 03:18:39","1-13","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer in the nervous system;Kinases;Ubiquitins;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: cancer-in-the-nervous-system;kinases;ubiquitins;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QK5SITL9/Zhang et al. - 2021 - K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A by TRAF2 allev.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EUA2FXBM/s41419-021-03887-2.html","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolutionary conservation of this process and its requirement for maintaining cellular homeostasis emphasizes the need to better dissect the pathways governing its molecular regulation. In our previously performed high-content screen, we assessed the effect of 1530 RNA-binding proteins on autophagy. Among the top regulators, we identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A-3 (eIF4A3). Here we show that depletion of eIF4A3 leads to a potent increase in autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis and an enhanced autophagic flux. This is mediated by the key autophagy transcription factor, TFEB, which becomes dephosphorylated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it elicits an integrated transcriptional response. We further identified an exon-skipping event in the transcript encoding for the direct TFEB kinase, GSK3B, which leads to a reduction in GSK3B expression and activity. Through analysis of TCGA data, we found a significant upregulation of eIF4A3 expression across several cancer types and confirmed the potential relevance of this newly identified signaling axis in human tumors. Hence, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role for eIF4A3 as a gatekeeper of autophagy through the control of TFEB activation, revealing a new mechanism for autophagy regulation.","2021-06-22","2021-07-01 03:25:34","2021-07-01 03:25:34","2021-07-01 03:25:34","1-13","","","","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Macroautophagy;Molecular biology;RNA;RNA-binding proteins Subject_term_id: macroautophagy;molecular-biology;rna;rna-binding-proteins","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/67WSUWDF/Sakellariou et al. - 2021 - eIF4A3 regulates the TFEB-mediated transcriptional.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/WCK9PLCU/s41418-021-00822-y.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that CUPs are a distinct, yet unrecognized, pathological entity originating from stem-like cells endowed with peculiar and shared properties. These cells can be isolated in vitro (agnospheres) and propagated in vivo by serial transplantation, displaying high tumorigenicity. After subcutaneous engraftment, agnospheres recapitulate the CUP phenotype, by spontaneously and quickly disseminating, and forming widespread established metastases. Regardless of different genetic backgrounds, agnospheres invariably display cell-autonomous proliferation and self-renewal, mostly relying on unrestrained activation of the MAP kinase/MYC axis, which confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Such sensitivity is associated with a transcriptomic signature predicting that more than 70% of CUP patients could be eligible to MEK inhibition.

Here we employ an unbiased kinome-wide siRNA screen to reveal that HER3, is essential for the proliferation of most HNSCC cells that do not harbor PIK3CA mutations. Indeed, we find that persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 and PI3K recruitment underlies aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in PIK3CA wild type HNSCCs. Remarkably, antibody-mediated HER3 blockade exerts a potent anti-tumor effect by suppressing HER3-PI3K-AKT-mTOR oncogenic signaling and concomitantly reversing the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.

Herein, we utilize HER2 transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME2) to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo response and recurrence upon T-DM1 treatment. Continuous in vitro dosing of HME2 cells with T-DM1 failed to produce a spontaneously resistant cell line. However, induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) via pretreatment with TGF-β1 was capable of promoting emergence of T-DM1-resistant (TDM1R) cells. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that induction of EMT decreased trastuzumab binding, prior to overt loss of HER2 expression in TDM1R cells. Kinome analyses of TDM1R cells indicated increased phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB4, and FGFR1. TDM1R cells failed to respond to the ErbB kinase inhibitors lapatinib and afatinib, but they acquired sensitivity to FIIN4, a covalent FGFR kinase inhibitor. In vivo, minimal residual disease (MRD) remained detectable via bioluminescent imaging following T-DM1-induced tumor regression. Upon cessation of the ADC, relapse occurred and secondary tumors were resistant to additional rounds of T-DM1. These recurrent tumors could be inhibited by FIIN4. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of FGFR1 was sufficient to enhance tumor growth, diminish trastuzumab binding, and promote recurrence following T-DM1-induced MRD. Finally, patient-derived xenografts from a HER2+ breast cancer patient who had progressed on trastuzumab failed to respond to T-DM1, but tumor growth was significantly inhibited by FIIN4. Overall, our studies strongly support therapeutic combination of TDM1 with FGFR-targeted agents in HER2+ breast cancer.","2021-01-21","2021-07-01 03:46:44","2021-07-02 22:31:05","2021-07-01 03:46:44","1-11","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer models;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Receptor pharmacology;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-models;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;receptor-pharmacology;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FMM9AVAE/Akhand et al. - 2021 - Fibroblast growth factor receptor facilitates recu.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/C24SW33M/s41523-020-00213-5.html","","Low; Indiana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sensitive monitoring platform for cancer-associated miRNA (oncomiR) action is needed for mechanistic studies, preclinical evaluation, and inhibitor screening. In this study, we developed and systemically applied a sensitive and efficient lentivirus-based system for monitoring oncomiR actions, essentially miR-21. The specificity and sensitivity of “miRDREL” against various oncomiRs were validated by checking for tight correlations between their expression and targeting efficacy. Experiments based on the transfection of synthetic mimics and antagomir-mediated depletion of oncomiRs further confirmed the specificity of the system. Systemic application of miRDRELs to natural oncomiR targets, knockdown of key microprocessors, and physiological triggering of oncomiRs also demonstrated that the system is an effective tool for monitoring cellular oncomiR action. Importantly, molecular modeling-based screening confirmed the action of the miR-21-targeting drug ivermectin and led to the identification of a new effective derivative, GW4064, for inhibiting oncogenic DDX23-miR-21 signaling. Furthermore, proteomic-kinase inhibitor screenings identified a novel oncogenic kinome-DDX23-miR-21 axis and thus expands our understanding of miR-21 targeting therapeutics in tumorigenesis. Taken together, these data indicate that miRDREL and its versatile application have great potential in basic, preclinical studies and drug development pipelines for miRNA-related diseases, especially cancer.","2020-12","2021-07-01 03:53:38","2021-07-02 19:22:42","2021-07-01 03:53:38","1989-2004","","12","52","","Exp Mol Med","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 12 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell signalling;Oncogenes Subject_term_id: cell-signalling;oncogenes","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BGYL4FEI/Seo et al. - 2020 - Development of a miRNA-controlled dual-sensing sys.pdf","","Low","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanically, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AL354740.1-204 (also named as NUDT3-AS4) acts as a microRNA sponge to compete with AKT1/mTOR mRNAs for binding to miR-99s, leading to decrease in degradation of AKT1/mTOR mRNAs and subsequent increase in AKT1/mTOR protein expression. Inhibition of lncRNA-NUDT3-AS4 and suppression of the NUDT3-AS4/miR-99s association contribute to Comp34-affected biologic pathways. In addition, Comp34 alone is effective in cells with secondary resistance to rapamycin, the best-known inhibitor of mTOR, and displays a greater in vivo antitumor efficacy and lower toxicity than rapamycin in TNBC xenografted models. In conclusion, NUDT3-AS4 may play a proproliferative role in TNBC and be considered a relevant therapeutic target, and Comp34 presents promising activity as a single agent to inhibit TNBC through regulation of NUDT3-AS4 and miR-99s.","2020-12-11","2021-07-01 03:53:54","2021-07-02 19:25:38","2021-07-01 03:53:54","1-18","","12","11","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 12 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Diseases;Drug discovery Subject_term_id: diseases;drug-discovery","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2444IRR6/Hao et al. - 2020 - Comp34 displays potent preclinical antitumor effic.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RDXRGR5G/s41419-020-03235-w.html","","Medium; LA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PAK4 knockout induces adhesion protein re-expression in ECs, reduces vascular abnormalities, improves T cell infiltration and inhibits GBM growth in mice. Moreover, PAK4 inhibition normalizes the tumor vascular microenvironment and sensitizes GBM to chimeric antigen receptor–T cell immunotherapy.

While enhancing CHIP functionality has broad therapeutic potential, prior efforts have all relied on genetic upregulation. Here we report that CHIP-mediated protein turnover is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation at S20 (mouse, S19 human). This increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein half-life, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. PKG-mediated CHIP-pS20 or expressing CHIP-S20E (phosphomimetic) reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A amplifies both. In vivo, depressing PKG activity lowers CHIP-S20 phosphorylation and protein, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been canonically used in NSCLC treatment. However, prevalent innate and acquired resistances and EGFR kinase-independent pro-survival properties limit the clinical efficacy of EGFR TKIs. Therefore, the discovery of novel EGFR degraders is a promising approach towards improving therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. Here, we identified a 23-hydroxybetulinic acid derivative, namely DPBA, as a novel EGFR small-molecule ligand. It exerted potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in both EGFR wild type and mutant NSCLC by degrading EGFR. Mechanistic studies disclosed that DPBA binds to the EGFR extracellular domain at sites differing from those of EGF and EGFR. DPBA did not induce EGFR dimerization, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, but it significantly promoted EGFR degradation and repressed downstream survival pathways. Further analyses showed that DPBA induced clathrin-independent EGFR endocytosis mediated by flotillin-dependent lipid rafts and unaffected by EGFR TKIs. Activation of the early and late endosome markers rab5 and rab7 but not the recycling endosome marker rab11 was involved in DPBA-induced EGFR lysosomal degradation. The present study offers a new EGFR ligand for EGFR pharmacological degradation and proposes it as a potential treatment for EGFR-positive NSCLC, particularly NSCLC with innate or acquired EGFR TKI resistance. DPBA can also serve as a chemical probe in the studies on EGFR trafficking and degradation.","2020-10-09","2021-07-01 04:01:11","2021-07-02 19:59:18","2021-07-01 04:01:11","1-13","","1","5","","Sig Transduct Target Ther","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Drug development;Lung cancer Subject_term_id: drug-development;lung-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/UAJSCJLV/Yao et al. - 2020 - Discovery of a novel EGFR ligand DPBA that degrade.pdf","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The serine-13 residue of Lyn (Lyn-S13) was shown to be N-myristoylation-dependently phosphorylated. Although there have been more than 40 reports of mass spectrometric studies on phosphorylation at Lyn-S13, the kinase responsible remained unclear. We succeeded in identifying casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells co-expressing Lyn and CK1γ, the phosphorylation level of Lyn-S13 increased significantly. CK1γ is unique among the CK1 family (α, γ, δ, and ε) in carrying an S-palmitoylation site for membrane binding. Co-expression with the non-S-palmitoylated CK1γ mutant, which localized in the cytosol, gave no increase in the phosphorylation level at Lyn-S13. In HEK293 cells expressing the non-S-palmitoylated Lyn-C3A mutant, on the other hand, the Lyn-C3A mutant was phosphorylated at Lyn-S13, and the mutant remained at the Golgi.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding. Our results reveal the plasticity of an interface pocket within MEK sub-complexes and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs that target the RAS pathway.","2020-12","2021-07-01 04:02:28","2021-07-01 04:02:28","2021-07-01 04:02:28","509-514","","7838","588","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7838 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Chemical biology;Drug development;Kinases;X-ray crystallography Subject_term_id: cancer;chemical-biology;drug-development;kinases;x-ray-crystallography","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CV3XES9P/Khan et al. - 2020 - Structural basis for the action of the drug tramet.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ponatinib binds the BRAF dimer and stabilizes a distinct αC-helix conformation through interaction with a previously unrevealed allosteric site. Using these structural insights, we developed PHI1, a BRAF inhibitor that fully uncovers the allosteric site. PHI1 exhibits discrete cellular selectivity for BRAF dimers, with enhanced inhibition of the second protomer when the first protomer is occupied, comprising a novel class of dimer selective inhibitors.

MomC was active in all PCa cell lines at low micromolar concentrations and induced an unusual caspase-independent, non-apoptotic cell death. Kinase activity screening identified activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK1/2) to be one of the primary molecular mechanism of MomC anticancer activity. Functional assays demonstrated a specific and selective JNK1/2 activation prior to the induction of other cell death related processes. Inhibition of JNK1/2 by pretreatment with the JNK-inhibitor SP600125 antagonized cytotoxic activity of the marine compound. MomC caused an upregulation of cytotoxic ROS. However, in contrast to other ROS-inducing agents, co-treatment with PARP-inhibitor olaparib revealed antagonistic effects indicating an active PARP to be necessary for MomC activity. Interestingly, although no direct regulation of p38 and ERK1/2 were detected, active p38 kinase was required for MomC efficacy, while the inhibition of ERK1/2 increased its cytotoxicity.

Leveraging the temporal and acute control offered by our strategy, we show that FES activity is dispensable for differentiation of HL-60 cells towards macrophages.

Here, using a kinome-focused genetic screen, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-replication kinase CDC7 induces senescence selectively in liver cancer cells with mutations in TP53. A follow-up chemical screen identified the antidepressant sertraline as an agent that kills hepatocellular carcinoma cells that have been rendered senescent by inhibition of CDC7. Sertraline suppressed mTOR signalling, and selective drugs that target this pathway were highly effective in causing the apoptotic cell death of hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with a CDC7 inhibitor. The feedback reactivation of mTOR signalling after its inhibition6 is blocked in cells that have been treated with a CDC7 inhibitor, which leads to the sustained inhibition of mTOR and cell death. Using multiple in vivo mouse models of liver cancer, we show that treatment with combined inhibition of of CDC7 and mTOR results in a marked reduction of tumour growth.

SPAK kinase (STK39) is the CCC master regulator, which stimulates NKCC1 ionic influx and inhibits KCC-mediated efflux via phosphorylation at conserved, shared motifs. Upregulation of SPAK-dependent CCC phosphorylation has been implicated in several neurological diseases. Using a scaffold-hybrid strategy, we develop a novel potent and selective SPAK inhibitor, 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (“ZT-1a”). ZT-1a inhibits NKCC1 and stimulates KCCs by decreasing their SPAK-dependent phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a decreases inflammation-induced CCC phosphorylation in the choroid plexus and reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion in a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a reduces ischemia-induced CCC phosphorylation, attenuates cerebral edema, protects against brain damage, and improves outcomes in a model of stroke. These results suggest ZT-1a or related compounds may be effective CCC modulators with therapeutic potential for brain disorders associated with impaired ionic homeostasis.","2020-01-07","2021-07-01 04:10:48","2021-07-02 21:49:07","2021-07-01 04:10:48","78","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Stroke Subject_term_id: kinases;stroke","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZF8MS3VQ/Zhang et al. - 2020 - Modulation of brain cation-Cl − cotransport via th.pdf","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII.

Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of combination therapy with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. For these reasons, we investigated activated mTORC1/2 and EPH receptor-mediated signaling in sporadic and NF2-associated VS. Using primary human VS cells and a mouse allograft model of schwannoma, we evaluated the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib as monotherapies and in combination. Escalating dose-response experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 µM). In vivo, while AZD2014 and dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy exceeds that of either drug. Co-targeting the mTOR and EPH receptor pathways with these or similar compounds may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for VS, a condition for which there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.","2020-03-06","2021-07-01 04:13:19","2021-07-02 19:26:07","2021-07-01 04:13:19","4211","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Pharmacology;Tumour-suppressor proteins Subject_term_id: pharmacology;tumour-suppressor-proteins","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/796A23XJ/Sagers et al. - 2020 - Combination therapy with mTOR kinase inhibitor and.pdf","","Medium; Boston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of ‘classical’ oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M–checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition.","2020-06","2021-07-01 04:15:56","2021-07-02 22:37:36","2021-07-01 04:15:56","4781-4797","","25","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 25 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Breast cancer;Cancer models Subject_term_id: breast-cancer;cancer-models","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KG54F83U/Pancholi et al. - 2020 - Tumour kinome re-wiring governs resistance to palb.pdf","","Low; UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment.","2020-05","2021-07-01 04:17:08","2021-07-02 19:53:21","2021-07-01 04:17:08","3939-3951","","19","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 19 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer immunotherapy;Prostate cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-immunotherapy;prostate-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9BJLG6SC/Liu et al. - 2020 - p300CBP inhibition enhances the efficacy of progr.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HSRTAID7/s41388-020-1270-z.html","","High; Kentucky","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 causes Phelan-McDermid syndrome and autism, whereas duplication of the same gene leads to SHANK3 duplication syndrome, a disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric phenotypes including hyperactivity and bipolar disorder as well as epilepsy. We recently demonstrated the functional modularity of Shank3, which suggests that normalizing levels of Shank3 itself might be more fruitful than correcting pathways that function downstream of it for treatment of disorders caused by alterations in SHANK3 dosage. To identify upstream regulators of Shank3 abundance, we performed a kinome-wide siRNA screen and identified multiple kinases that potentially regulate Shank3 protein stability. Interestingly, we discovered that several kinases in the MEK/ERK2 pathway destabilize Shank3 and that genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of ERK2 increases Shank3 abundance in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that ERK2 binds Shank3 and phosphorylates it at three residues to promote its poly-ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Altogether, our findings uncover a druggable pathway as a potential therapeutic target for disorders with reduced SHANK3 dosage, provide a rich resource for studying Shank3 regulation, and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for identifying regulators of dosage-sensitive genes.","2020-10","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2021-07-02 19:01:45","2021-07-01 04:18:37","2504-2516","","10","25","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","en","2019 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 10 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Autism spectrum disorders;Biotechnology;Genetics Subject_term_id: autism-spectrum-disorders;biotechnology;genetics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4BL2SRTC/Wang et al. - 2020 - A kinome-wide RNAi screen identifies ERK2 as a dru.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4Y5AW72W/s41380-018-0325-9.html","","Medium; Houston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, its amino-terminal region binds FLASH, an RDH-specific 3′-end processing factor, which keeps the kinase on the chromatin. CDK11 phosphorylates serine 2 (Ser2) of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is initiated when RNAPII reaches the middle of RDH genes and is required for further RNAPII elongation and 3′-end processing. CDK11 depletion leads to decreased number of cells in S phase, likely owing to the function of CDK11 in RDH gene expression.

To further validate the role and druggability of CDK2 involved in AML differentiation, a suitable chemical tool is needed. Therefore, we developed first-in-class CDK2-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which promoted rapid and potent CDK2 degradation in different cell lines without comparable degradation of other targets, and induced remarkable differentiation of AML cell lines and primary patient cells.

Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of VCP ATPase activity, we show that VCP stabilizes Beclin-1 levels by promoting the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 towards Beclin-1. VCP also regulates the assembly and activity of the Beclin-1-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex I, thus regulating the production of PI(3)P, a key signaling lipid responsible for the recruitment of downstream autophagy factors. A decreased level of VCP, or inhibition of its ATPase activity, impairs starvation-induced production of PI(3)P and limits downstream recruitment of WIPI2, ATG16L and LC3, thereby decreasing autophagosome formation, illustrating an important role for VCP in early autophagy initiation.","2021-04","2021-07-01 04:32:03","2021-07-02 19:52:19","2021-07-01 04:32:03","448-455","","4","17","","Nat Chem Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Kinases;Membrane trafficking;Small molecules Subject_term_id: cell-death;kinases;membrane-trafficking;small-molecules","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/564GYEJR/Hill et al. - 2021 - VCPp97 regulates Beclin-1-dependent autophagy ini.pdf","","High; UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alterations in dosage of DYRK1A leads to defects in neurogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation, and may increase the risk of certain cancers. DYRK1A localizes to a number of subcellular structures including vesicles where it is known to phosphorylate a number of proteins and regulate vesicle biology. However, the mechanism by which it translocates to vesicles is poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of TRAF2, an E3 ligase, as an interaction partner of DYRK1A. Our data suggest that TRAF2 binds to PVQE motif residing in between the PEST and histidine repeat domain (HRD) of DYRK1A protein, and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of DYRK1A. This results in translocation of DYRK1A to the vesicle membrane.

Here, we use quantitative proteomics to determine cellular interaction partners of human herpesvirus (HHV) CHPKs. We find that CHPKs can target key regulators of transcription and replication. The interaction with Cyclin A and associated factors is identified as a signature of β-herpesvirus kinases. Cyclin A is recruited via RXL motifs that overlap with nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the non-catalytic N termini. This architecture is conserved in HHV6, HHV7 and rodent cytomegaloviruses. Cyclin A binding competes with NLS function, enabling dynamic changes in CHPK localization and substrate phosphorylation. The cytomegalovirus kinase M97 sequesters Cyclin A in the cytosol, which is essential for viral inhibition of cellular replication.

Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway.

One degrader induced rapid, durable and highly specific degradation of AURORA-A. In addition, we found that the degrader complex was stabilized by cooperative binding between AURORA-A and CEREBLON. Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication.

Mice bearing a Speg3A mutation to prevent its phosphorylation by PKB display cardiac dysfunction. Importantly, the Speg3A mutation impairs SERCA2a phosphorylation and calcium re-uptake into the SR.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding. Our results reveal the plasticity of an interface pocket within MEK sub-complexes and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs that target the RAS pathway.","2020-12","2021-07-01 04:37:53","2021-07-01 04:37:53","2021-07-01 04:37:53","509-514","","7838","588","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7838 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Chemical biology;Drug development;Kinases;X-ray crystallography Subject_term_id: cancer;chemical-biology;drug-development;kinases;x-ray-crystallography","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TQ2EVJ52/Khan et al. - 2020 - Structural basis for the action of the drug tramet.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shortened mitosis causes tumorigenic aneuploidy, but it is unclear whether it also activates the apoptotic machinery2. Separase, a cysteine protease and trigger of all eukaryotic anaphases, has a caspase-like catalytic domain but has not previously been associated with cell death3,4. Here we show that human cells that enter mitosis with already active separase rapidly undergo death in mitosis owing to direct cleavage of anti-apoptotic MCL1 and BCL-XL by separase. Cleavage not only prevents MCL1 and BCL-XL from sequestering pro-apoptotic BAK, but also converts them into active promoters of death in mitosis. Our data strongly suggest that the deadliest cleavage fragment, the C-terminal half of MCL1, forms BAK/BAX-like pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. MCL1 and BCL-XL are turned into separase substrates only upon phosphorylation by NEK2A. Early mitotic degradation of this kinase is therefore crucial for preventing apoptosis upon scheduled activation of separase in metaphase. Speeding up mitosis by abrogation of the spindle assembly checkpoint results in a temporal overlap of the enzymatic activities of NEK2A and separase and consequently in cell death. We propose that NEK2A and separase jointly check on spindle assembly checkpoint integrity and eliminate cells that are prone to chromosome missegregation owing to accelerated progression through early mitosis.","2020-04","2021-07-01 04:38:58","2021-07-02 19:43:07","2021-07-01 04:38:58","542-547","","7804","580","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7804 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Checkpoints;Kinases;Mitosis;Proteases Subject_term_id: apoptosis;checkpoints;kinases;mitosis;proteases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YHJRRCMG/Hellmuth and Stemmann - 2020 - Separase-triggered apoptosis enforces minimal leng.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QPYN9QKL/s41586-020-2187-y.html","","Germany; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drugs targeting the prevalent oncogenic mutant BRAF(V600E) have shown great efficacy in the clinic, but long-term effectiveness is limited by resistance mechanisms that often exploit the dimerization-dependent process by which RAF kinases are activated. Here, we investigated a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) approach to BRAF inhibition.

By substituting a serine residue into cysteine at the DFG-1 position in the ATP-binding pocket, we sensitize the non-receptor tyrosine kinase FES towards covalent labeling by a complementary fluorescent chemical probe. This mutation is introduced in the endogenous FES gene of HL-60 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Leveraging the temporal and acute control offered by our strategy, we show that FES activity is dispensable for differentiation of HL-60 cells towards macrophages. Instead, FES plays a key role in neutrophil phagocytosis via SYK kinase activation.

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). These results demonstrate that in response to CDDP ICLs, TFAs promote p53-dependent apoptosis through the enhancement of the Nox-RIP1-ASK1-MAPK pathway activation, providing insight into the diverse pathogenetic mechanisms of TFAs according to the types of DNA damage.","2021-05-14","2021-07-01 04:40:51","2021-07-02 19:48:36","2021-07-01 04:40:51","10350","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Cell signalling;Kinases;Lipids;Risk factors Subject_term_id: cell-death;cell-signalling;kinases;lipids;risk-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RQSP6E9K/Hirata et al. - 2021 - trans -Fatty acids promote p53-dependent apoptosis.pdf","","High; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues. Cells from these mice show normal STAT phosphorylation in response to JAK3 dependent cytokines but are resistant to the effects of covalent JAK3 inhibitors. These mice therefore provide a chemical-genetic model to study JAK3 function.","2021-05-12","2021-07-01 04:40:59","2021-07-02 19:47:44","2021-07-01 04:40:59","10093","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cytokines;Immunology;Kinases;Medicinal chemistry Subject_term_id: cytokines;immunology;kinases;medicinal-chemistry","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/Z3QBGH6Q/Remenyi et al. - 2021 - Generation of a chemical genetic model for JAK3.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R55GGHL7/s41598-021-89356-4.html","","High; Boston; Interesting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, OTUD3 is highly expressed in human lung cancer tissues and its higher expression correlates with poorer survival of patients. Further mechanistic studies reveal that OTUD3 interacts with, deubiquitylates and stabilizes the glucose-regulated protein GRP78. Knockdown of OTUD3 results in a decrease in the level of GRP78 protein, suppression of cell growth and migration, and tumorigenesis in lung cancer.

STRIPAK also serves as a master regulator for the STE20 family kinases. Following serum or lysophosphatidic acid stimulation, active RhoA binds and dissociates rhophilin and NF2/Kibra from STRIPAK, thereby inducing the association and dephosphorylation of MST1/2 and MAP4Ks by the STRIPAK phosphatase catalytic subunit PP2AC. Rhophilin suppresses cancer cell growth by activating the Hippo pathway.

In this study, we investigate an alternative strategy of targeting the D-recruitment site (DRS) of ERK. The DRS is a conserved region that lies distal to the active site and mediates ERK–protein interactions. We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo. BI-78D3 does not covalently modify p38MAPK, JNK or ERK5. BI-78D3 promotes apoptosis in BRAF inhibitor-naive and resistant melanoma cells containing a BRAF V600E mutation. These studies provide the basis for designing modulators of protein–protein interactions involving ERK, with the potential to impact ERK signaling dynamics and to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ERK-dependent cancers.","2019-11-19","2021-07-01 05:39:00","2021-07-02 19:55:59","2021-07-01 05:39:00","5232","","1","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Drug development;Kinases;Mechanism of action;Melanoma;Molecular medicine Subject_term_id: drug-development;kinases;mechanism-of-action;melanoma;molecular-medicine","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KK4SHM3R/Kaoud et al. - 2019 - Modulating multi-functional ERK complexes by coval.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/NXJXVG98/s41467-019-12996-8.html","","High; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). These data suggest that a principal mTORC2 action is controlling nuclear-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthesis.","2020-01-29","2021-07-01 05:39:48","2021-07-02 21:45:20","2021-07-01 05:39:48","575","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Proteomics Subject_term_id: kinases;proteomics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/LW7KFD37/Martinez Calejman et al. - 2020 - mTORC2-AKT signaling to ATP-citrate lyase drives b.pdf","","High; Boston; Philadelphia; Seatle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanistic studies reveal that the increased cytotoxic activity correlates with an increase in AML-NK cell conjugates. GSK3 inhibition promotes the conjugate formation by upregulating LFA expression on NK cells and by inducing ICAM-1 expression on AML cells. The latter is mediated by increased NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α production by NK cells. Finally, GSK3-inhibited NK cells show significant efficacy in human AML mouse models.

Genetic loss of the Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in ULK1 that disrupt the binding of Cu reduced ULK1/2-dependent signalling and the formation of autophagosome complexes. Increased levels of intracellular Cu are associated with starvation-induced autophagy and are sufficient to enhance ULK1 kinase activity and, in turn, autophagic flux. The growth and survival of lung tumours driven by KRASG12D is diminished in the absence of Ctr1, is dependent on ULK1 Cu binding and is associated with reduced levels of autophagy and signalling.

Mass spectrometry revealed that AKT target activity was altered in GCBCs compared with naive B cells. Retargeting was linked to differential AKT T308 and S473 phosphorylation, in turn controlled by GC-specific upregulation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 and the phosphatase PTEN. In GCBCs, AKT preferentially targeted CSK, SHP-1 and HPK1, which are negative regulators of BCR signaling.

Using protein microarrays, we identify Cyclin Y as an AMPK substrate that is phosphorylated at Serine 326 (S326) both in vitro and in cells. Phosphorylation of Cyclin Y at S326 promotes its interaction with the Cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), thereby stimulating its catalytic activity. When expressed in cells, Cyclin Y/CDK16 is sufficient to promote autophagy. Moreover, Cyclin Y/CDK16 is necessary for efficient AMPK-dependent activation of autophagy.

Ligand-induced monoubiquitination and endosomal puncta of BIK1 exhibit spatial and temporal dynamics that are distinct from those of the PRR FLS2.

Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) dephosphorylates 53BP1 in late mitosis to allow its recruitment to DNA lesions in G1. How cells appropriately dephosphorylate 53BP1, thereby restoring DDR, is unclear. Here, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of kinetic control of 53BP1 dephosphorylation in mitosis. We demonstrate that CDK5, a kinase primarily functional in post-mitotic neurons, is active in late mitotic phases in non-neuronal cells and directly phosphorylates PP4R3β, the PP4 regulatory subunit that recognizes 53BP1. Specific inhibition of CDK5 in mitosis abrogates PP4R3β phosphorylation and abolishes its recognition and dephosphorylation of 53BP1, ultimately preventing the localization of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin.

SREBPs are inhibited by a complex composed of INSIG proteins, SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and sterols in the endoplasmic reticulum. Regulation of the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP by sterol levels is critical for the dissociation of the SCAP–SREBP complex from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of SREBPs1,2. However, whether this protein interaction is regulated by a mechanism other than the abundance of sterol—and in particular, whether oncogenic signalling has a role—is unclear. Here we show that activated AKT in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells phosphorylates cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, at Ser90. Phosphorylated PCK1 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it uses GTP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151. This phosphorylation reduces the binding of sterols to INSIG1 and INSIG2 and disrupts the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP, leading to the translocation of the SCAP–SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus, the activation of SREBP proteins (SREBP1 or SREBP2) and the transcription of downstream lipogenesis-related genes, proliferation of tumour cells, and tumorigenesis in mice. In addition, phosphorylation of PCK1 at Ser90, INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151 is not only positively correlated with the nuclear accumulation of SREBP1 in samples from patients with HCC, but also associated with poor HCC prognosis. Our findings highlight the importance of the protein kinase activity of PCK1 in the activation of SREBPs, lipogenesis and the development of HCC.","2020-04","2021-07-01 05:46:03","2021-09-07 21:00:48","2021-07-01 05:46:03","530-535","","7804","580","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7804 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Kinases Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;kinases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KUFDG5SM/Xu et al. - 2020 - The gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1 phosphorylates INSIG.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/SDQNW2BY/s41586-020-2183-2.html","","China; Most Ever; _company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block. Hence, PP2A-B55δ acts critically on Arpp19 on two distinct sites, opposing PKA and Greatwall to orchestrate the prophase release and M-phase entry.","2021-03-23","2021-07-01 05:46:28","2021-07-02 22:12:02","2021-07-01 05:46:28","1837","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Meiosis;Oogenesis;Phosphorylation;Xenopus Subject_term_id: kinases;meiosis;oogenesis;phosphorylation;xenopus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YVH88A76/Lemonnier et al. - 2021 - The M-phase regulatory phosphatase PP2A-B55δ oppos.pdf","","Paris; Extreme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FBXW2 overexpression reduces β-catenin levels and protein half-life, whereas FBXW2 knockdown increases β-catenin levels, protein half-life and transcriptional activity. Functionally, FBXW2 overexpression inhibits migration and invasion by blocking transactivation of MMPs driven by β-catenin, whereas FXBW2 knockdown promotes migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. In human lung cancer specimens, while FBXW2 levels are inversely correlated with β-catenin levels and lymph-node metastasis, lower FBXW2 coupled with higher β-catenin, predict a worse patient survival.

This role of CMA in genome quality control is exerted through regulated degradation of activated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by this pathway after the genotoxic insult. Nuclear accumulation of Chk1 in CMA-deficient cells compromises cell cycle progression and prolongs the time that DNA damage persists in these cells. Furthermore, blockage of CMA leads to hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of the MRN (Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1) complex, which participates in early steps of particular DNA repair pathways.

How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural. Here, we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full-length version of CENP-C, the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly. We show that full-length CENP-C, a dimer, binds stably to two nucleosomes and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios closely matching those of endogenous human kinetochores. Our results imply that human kinetochores emerge from clustering multiple copies of a fundamental module and may have important implications for transgenerational inheritance of centromeric chromatin.

Here, we study the cross-talk between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras signaling during lacrimal gland budding morphogenesis. Our results show that PI3K is activated by both the p85-mediated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Ras-mediated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. On the other hand, PI3K also promotes extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via a direct interaction with Ras. Both PI3K and ERK are upstream regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and, together, they prevent expansion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region. We further show that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for induction of lacrimal gland buds.

Colchicine binds tubulin and depolymerizes microtubules, but it remains unclear how this mechanism blocks myeloid cell recruitment to inflamed tissues. Here we show that colchicine inhibits myeloid cell activation via an indirect mechanism involving the release of hepatokines. We find that a safe dose of colchicine depolymerizes microtubules selectively in hepatocytes but not in circulating myeloid cells. Mechanistically, colchicine triggers Nrf2 activation in hepatocytes, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory hepatokines, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Nrf2 and GDF15 are required for the anti-inflammatory action of colchicine in vivo. Plasma from colchicine-treated mice inhibits inflammatory signalling in myeloid cells in a GDF15-dependent manner, by positive regulation of SHP-1 (PTPN6) phosphatase, although the precise molecular identities of colchicine-induced GDF15 and its receptor require further characterization. Our work shows that the efficacy and safety of colchicine depend on its selective action on hepatocytes, and reveals a new axis of liver–myeloid cell communication. Plasma GDF15 levels and myeloid cell SHP-1 activity may be useful pharmacodynamic biomarkers of colchicine action.","2021-04","2021-07-12 05:28:22","2021-07-12 17:00:34","2021-07-12 05:28:22","513-522","","4","3","","Nat Metab","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Acute inflammation;Mechanism of action;Metabolism;Pharmacodynamics Subject_term_id: acute-inflammation;mechanism-of-action;metabolism;pharmacodynamics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5UYXZLVX/Weng et al. - 2021 - Colchicine acts selectively in the liver to induce.pdf","","Boston; 26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this need, we conducted an autophagy phenotype-based screen and identified the natural compound kaempferide (Kaem) as an autophagy enhancer. Kaem promoted autophagy through translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) without MTOR perturbation, suggesting it is safe for administration. Moreover, Kaem accelerated lipid droplet degradation in a lysosomal activity-dependent manner in vitro and ameliorated metabolic dysregulation in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. To elucidate the mechanism underlying Kaem’s biological activity, the target protein was identified via combined drug affinity responsive target stability and LC–MS/MS analyses. Kaem directly interacted with the mitochondrial elongation factor TUFM, and TUFM absence reversed Kaem-induced autophagy and lipid degradation. Kaem also induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) to sequentially promote lysosomal Ca2+ efflux, TFEB translocation and autophagy induction, suggesting a role of TUFM in mtROS regulation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Kaem is a potential therapeutic candidate/chemical tool for treating metabolic dysregulation and reveal a role for TUFM in autophagy for metabolic regulation with lipid overload.","2021-01-04","2021-07-12 05:31:30","2021-07-12 17:22:34","2021-07-12 05:31:30","1-17","","1","4","","Commun Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Mechanism of action;Molecular medicine Subject_term_id: mechanism-of-action;molecular-medicine","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JEJ384L9/Kim et al. - 2021 - Activation of mitochondrial TUFM ameliorates metab.pdf","","South Korea; 10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to γ-secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235 mg/kg and 470 mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131).","2021-05-31","2021-07-12 05:33:14","2021-07-12 17:06:20","2021-07-12 05:33:14","1-20","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Bladder cancer;Pharmacodynamics Subject_term_id: bladder-cancer;pharmacodynamics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/SEHF3PYA/Weir et al. - 2021 - Fosciclopirox suppresses growth of high-grade urot.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GPSB8JXS/s41419-021-03836-z.html","","7; Kansas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AKT kinases are the canonical mTORC2 substrates; however, deleting Rictor in brown adipocytes appears to drive lipid catabolism by promoting FoxO1 deacetylation independently of AKT, and in a pathway distinct from its positive role in anabolic lipid synthesis. This facilitates FoxO1 nuclear retention, enhances lipid uptake and lipolysis, and potentiates UCP1 expression. We provide evidence that SIRT6 is the FoxO1 deacetylase suppressed by mTORC2 and show an endogenous interaction between SIRT6 and mTORC2 in both mouse and human cells.

Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S473 [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T308 (PDK1 site).

Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S473 and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis-vaccenic acid (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection.

Interestingly, both FOXO1 and thyroid hormone (TH) have similar effects on carbohydrate and energy metabolism as well as overlapping transcriptional regulation of many target genes. Currently, little is known about the regulation of MTORC2-AKT or FOXO1 by TH. Accordingly, we performed hepatic transcriptome profiling in mice after FOXO1 knockdown in the absence or presence of TH, and we compared these results with hepatic FOXO1 and THRB1 (TRβ1) ChIP-Seq data. We identified a subset of TH-stimulated FOXO1 target genes that required co-regulation by FOXO1 and TH. TH activation of FOXO1 was directly linked to an increase in SIRT1-MTORC2 interaction and RICTOR deacetylation. This, in turn, led to decreased AKT and FOXO1 phosphorylation. Moreover, TH increased FOXO1 nuclear localization, DNA binding, and target gene transcription by reducing AKT-dependent FOXO1 phosphorylation in a THRB1-dependent manner. These events were associated with TH-mediated oxidative phosphorylation and NAD(+) production and suggested that downstream metabolic effects by TH can post-translationally activate other transcription factors. Our results showed that RICTOR/MTORC2-AKT can integrate convergent hormonal and metabolic signals to provide coordinated and sensitive regulation of hepatic FOXO1-target gene expression.","2016-01-01","2021-07-12 05:40:59","2021-07-12 16:58:28","","198-214","","1","291","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26453307 PMCID: PMC4697156","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KR9EH4BB/Singh et al. - 2016 - Hepatic FOXO1 Target Genes Are Co-regulated by Thy.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453307","Medium; Medium-High; Singapore","Phosphorylation; Animals; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein; Acetylation; AKT; carbohydrate metabolism; Carrier Proteins; Cell Nucleus; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Enzyme Activation; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; gene regulation; gluconeogenesis; Hep G2 Cells; insulin signaling; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MTORC2; Multiprotein Complexes; NAD; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; RICTOR; Sirtuin 1; thyroid hormone; Thyroid Hormones; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; transcription coregulator; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). These data suggest that a principal mTORC2 action is controlling nuclear-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthesis.","2020-01-29","2021-07-12 05:45:15","2021-07-12 17:04:50","2021-07-12 05:45:15","575","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Proteomics Subject_term_id: kinases;proteomics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FSFDA3Y4/Martinez Calejman et al. - 2020 - mTORC2-AKT signaling to ATP-citrate lyase drives b.pdf","","Boston; 11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activated NRF2 regulates multiple downstream molecules involved in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, translational control, and treatment resistance; however, targeting NRF2 for pancreatic cancer therapy remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used the online computational tool CellMinerTM to explore the NCI-60 drug databases for compounds with anticancer activities correlating most closely with the mRNA expression of NQO1, a marker for NRF2 pathway activity. Among the >100,000 compounds analyzed, NSC84167, termed herein as NRF2 synthetic lethality compound-01 (NSLC01), was one of the top hits (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) and selected for functional characterization. NSLC01 selectively inhibited the viabilities of four out of seven conventional pancreatic cancer cell lines and induced dramatic apoptosis in the cells with high NRF2 activation. The selective anticancer activity of NSLC01 was further validated with a panel of nine low-passage pancreatic patient-derived cell lines, and a significant reverse correlation between log(IC50) of NSLC01 and NQO1 expression was confirmed (r = −0.5563, P = 0.024). Notably, screening of a panel of nine patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) revealed six PDXs with high NQO1/NRF2 activation, and NSLC01 dramatically inhibited the viabilities and induced apoptosis in ex vivo cultures of PDX tumors. Consistent with the ex vivo results, NSLC01 inhibited the tumor growth of two NRF2-activated PDX models in vivo (P < 0.01, n = 7–8) but had no effects on the NRF2-low counterpart. To characterize the mechanism of action, we employed a metabolomic isotope tracer assay that demonstrated that NSLC01-mediated inhibition of de novo synthesis of multiple amino acids, including asparagine and methionine. Importantly, we further found that NSLC01 suppresses the eEF2K/eEF2 translation elongation cascade and protein translation of asparagine synthetase. In summary, this study identified a novel compound that selectively targets protein translation and induces synthetic lethal effects in NRF2-activated pancreatic cancers.","2021-07-10","2021-07-12 05:54:01","2021-07-12 17:08:47","2021-07-12 05:54:01","1-11","","7","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Drug discovery;Gastrointestinal diseases Subject_term_id: drug-discovery;gastrointestinal-diseases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/3RT6V2ZK/Dai et al. - 2021 - Compound NSC84167 selectively targets NRF2-activat.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HP492G88/s41419-021-03970-8.html","","High; Texas; HTF (Contact hard to find); 8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of livers from RagAGTP mice reveal a failed metabolic adaptation to fasting due to a global impairment in PPARα transcriptional program. These metabolic defects are partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and revert by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. Constitutive hepatic nutrient signaling does not cause hepatocellular damage and carcinomas, unlike genetic activation of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1.

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues. Cells from these mice show normal STAT phosphorylation in response to JAK3 dependent cytokines but are resistant to the effects of covalent JAK3 inhibitors. These mice therefore provide a chemical-genetic model to study JAK3 function.","2021-05-12","2021-07-12 06:07:32","2021-07-12 17:16:43","2021-07-12 06:07:32","10093","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cytokines;Immunology;Kinases;Medicinal chemistry Subject_term_id: cytokines;immunology;kinases;medicinal-chemistry","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ6DJNU2/Remenyi et al. - 2021 - Generation of a chemical genetic model for JAK3.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EL2QYCGB/s41598-021-89356-4.html","","UK; 15; Dundee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). These results demonstrate that in response to CDDP ICLs, TFAs promote p53-dependent apoptosis through the enhancement of the Nox-RIP1-ASK1-MAPK pathway activation, providing insight into the diverse pathogenetic mechanisms of TFAs according to the types of DNA damage.","2021-05-14","2021-07-12 06:07:42","2021-07-12 16:54:41","2021-07-12 06:07:42","10350","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Cell signalling;Kinases;Lipids;Risk factors Subject_term_id: cell-death;cell-signalling;kinases;lipids;risk-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/E79Q5N6V/Hirata et al. - 2021 - trans -Fatty acids promote p53-dependent apoptosis.pdf","","High; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key players of M-phase entry are the opposing Cdk1 kinase and PP2A-B55δ phosphatase. In Xenopus, the protein Arpp19, phosphorylated at serine 67 by Greatwall, plays an essential role in inhibiting PP2A-B55δ, promoting Cdk1 activation. Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block. Hence, PP2A-B55δ acts critically on Arpp19 on two distinct sites, opposing PKA and Greatwall to orchestrate the prophase release and M-phase entry.","2021-03-23","2021-07-12 06:10:03","2021-07-12 16:55:00","2021-07-12 06:10:03","1837","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Kinases;Meiosis;Oogenesis;Phosphorylation;Xenopus Subject_term_id: kinases;meiosis;oogenesis;phosphorylation;xenopus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VSUIV9CV/Lemonnier et al. - 2021 - The M-phase regulatory phosphatase PP2A-B55δ oppos.pdf","","High; France","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, α4 KD did increase the phosphorylation of p53 and ATM/ATR substrates, decreased the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and associated fragments. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was reduced, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic BAX protein did not change.

The sensitivity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity was augmented by α4 KD. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of α4 protein in ARVM increased PP2AC expression and augmented H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin.

While mTORC1 activation at the lysosome is well characterized, it is not clear how this complex is regulated at other subcellular locations. Here, we combine location-selective kinase inhibition, live-cell imaging and biochemical assays to probe the regulation of growth factor-induced mTORC1 activity in the nucleus. Using a nuclear targeted Akt Substrate-based Tandem Occupancy Peptide Sponge (Akt-STOPS) that we developed for specific inhibition of Akt, a critical upstream kinase, we show that growth factor-stimulated nuclear mTORC1 activity requires nuclear Akt activity. Further mechanistic dissection suggests that nuclear Akt activity mediates growth factor-induced nuclear translocation of Raptor, a regulatory scaffolding component in mTORC1, and localization of Raptor to the nucleus results in nuclear mTORC1 activity in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Taken together, these results reveal a mode of regulation of mTORC1 that is distinct from its lysosomal activation, which controls mTORC1 activity in the nuclear compartment.","2020-11-30","2021-07-12 06:13:19","2021-07-12 16:11:08","2021-07-12 06:13:19","6088","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Kinases;Nucleus Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;kinases;nucleus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TNTS79UZ/Zhou et al. - 2020 - Location-specific inhibition of Akt reveals regula.pdf","","Low; San Diego","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit route of flaviviruses in LC3+ secretory organelles that enables them to evade circulating antibodies and might affect tissue tropism.","2020-10-15","2021-07-12 06:14:08","2021-07-12 16:49:01","2021-07-12 06:14:08","5189","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Dengue virus;Kinases;Virus–host interactions Subject_term_id: dengue-virus;kinases;virus-host-interactions","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7U69S884/Li et al. - 2020 - Lyn kinase regulates egress of flaviviruses in aut.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MWS2FKUJ/s41467-020-19028-w.html","","UK; Hong Kong; Medium-High","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding.

We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates. Structures of MAPK-TAD complexes and mechanistic modeling of ATF2 TAD phosphorylation in cells suggest that kinase binding motifs and phosphorylation sites line up to maximize MAPK based co-regulation.

Protein, but not mRNA, levels of CRTC2, a crucial transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenesis, are >50% lower in Sam68-deficient hepatocytes than in wild-type hepatocytes. Sam68 interacts with CRTC2 and reduces CRTC2 ubiquitination. However, truncated mutants of Sam68 that lack the C- (Sam68ΔC) or N-terminal (Sam68ΔN) domains fails to bind CRTC2 or to stabilize CRTC2 protein, respectively, and transgenic Sam68ΔN mice recapitulate the blood-glucose and gluconeogenesis profile of Sam68-deficient mice. Hepatic Sam68 expression is also upregulated in patients with diabetes and in two diabetic mouse models, while hepatocyte-specific Sam68 deficiencies alleviate diabetic hyperglycemia and improves insulin sensitivity in mice.

Here, we demonstrate that BMPER is a driver of insulin sensitivity. Both global and endothelial cell-specific inducible knockout of BMPER cause hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance without increasing inflammation in metabolic tissues in mice. BMPER can directly activate insulin signaling, which requires its internalization and interaction with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), an integral membrane protein that transports intracellular cholesterol. These results suggest that the endocrine function of the vascular endothelium maintains glucose homeostasis.

Consistent with this, mice bearing a Vav2 protein with decreased catalytic activity exhibit reduced muscle mass, lack of proper insulin responsiveness and, at much later times, a metabolic syndrome-like condition.

However, the exact mechanisms of free fatty acid (FFA)-induced podocyte insulin unresponsiveness are poorly understood. We used a type 2 diabetic mouse model (db/db) and mouse podocytes exposed to palmitic acid for 24 h followed by an insulin stimulation. Renal function and pathology were evaluated at 25 weeks of age to confirm the DN development. Our results demonstrate that saturated FFA activated the serine/threonine kinases IκB kinase (IKK)β/IκBα and mTORC1/S6K1, but not protein kinase C and c-jun N-terminal kinase, in podocytes and glomeruli of db/db mice. Activation of both kinases promoted serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1, a residue known to provoke IRS1 inhibition. Using IKK, mTORC1 and ceramide production inhibitors, we were able to blunt IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation and restore insulin stimulation of Akt.

Phosphorylation of STAT5a serine residues, S726 and S780, may regulate STAT5a in such a way to underlie this duality. Given hematopoiesis studies showing phospho-serine STAT5a as necessary for transformation, we hypothesized that serine phosphorylation regulates STAT5a activity to contribute to its role in mammary oncogenesis, specifically in luminal breast cancer. Here, phosphorylation of S726-, S780-, and Y694-STAT5a in response to prolactin in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells was investigated with STAT5a knockdown and rescue with Y694F-, S726A-, or S780A-STAT5a, where the phospho-sites were mutated. RNA-sequencing and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that loss of each phospho-site differentially affected both prolactin-induced gene expression as well as functional pathways of breast cancer (e.g. cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation). In vitro studies of anchorage-independent growth and proliferation confirmed distinct phenotypes: whereas S780A-STAT5a decreased clonogenicity, S726A-STAT5a decreased proliferation in response to prolactin compared to wild type STAT5a.

Hence, identification of factors involved in the regulation of AR expression and function is a necessary first-step to improve disease outcome. In this study, we identified ubiquitous βArrestin 1 (βArr1) as a regulator of AR function in CRPC. Unbiased gene expression analysis of public datasets revealed increased levels of ARRB1 (the gene encoding βArr1) in CRPC when compared to normal tissue. Further, βArr1 expression correlated with enhanced AR transcriptional function in these datasets. The βArr1 partitions to both nucleus and cytosol and mechanistic studies showed that nuclear, and not cytosolic, βArr1 formed a complex with AR and AR-coregulator βCatenin and that the heterotrimeric protein complex was recruited to androgen-response elements of AR-regulated genes.

The accumulation of damaged or unfolded proteins triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can act as a homeostatic response or lead to cell death. However, the factors involved in turning and adaptive response into a cell death mechanism are still not well understood. Several mechanisms leading to brain injury induced by severe hypoglycemia have been described but the contribution of the UPR has been poorly studied. Cell responses triggered during both the hypoglycemia and the glucose reinfusion periods can contribute to neuronal death. Therefore, we have investigated the activation dynamics of the PERK and the IRE1α branches of the UPR and their contribution to neuronal death in a model of glucose deprivation (GD) and glucose reintroduction (GR) in cortical neurons. Results show a rapid activation of the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4 pathway leading to protein synthesis inhibition during GD, which contributes to neuronal adaptation, however, sustained blockade of protein synthesis during GR promotes neuronal death. On the other hand, IRE1α activation occurs early during GD due to its interaction with BAK/BAX, while ASK1 is recruited to IRE1α activation complex during GR promoting the nuclear translocation of JNK and the upregulation of Chop. Most importantly, results show that IRE1α RNase activity towards its splicing target Xbp1 mRNA occurs late after GR, precluding a homeostatic role. Instead, IRE1α activity during GR drives neuronal death by positively regulating ASK1/JNK activity through the degradation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA, a negative regulator of ASK and an adaptor protein highly expressed in brain, implicated in neuroprotection. Collectively, results describe a novel regulatory mechanism of cell death in neurons, triggered by the downregulation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA induced by the IRE1α branch of the UPR.","2021-06-03","2021-07-12 06:45:23","2021-07-12 16:47:06","2021-07-12 06:45:23","1-15","","1","7","","Cell Death Discov.","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death in the nervous system;Molecular neuroscience;Stress signalling Subject_term_id: cell-death-in-the-nervous-system;molecular-neuroscience;stress-signalling","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D444NY32/Gómora-García et al. - 2021 - IRE1α RIDD activity induced under ER stress drives.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7PRE9AJ7/s41420-021-00518-9.html","","Medium; Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interferon (IFN) induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to promote innate immunity and inhibit malignant tumor growth, but the functions and mechanisms of most ISGs in cancer regulation are unknown. As an innate immune effector, ISG12a promotes the innate immune response to viral infection. In this study, ISG12a was found to be expressed at low levels in gastrointestinal cancer, represented by hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC), and it identified as a tumor suppressor that affects clinical prognosis. ISG12a silencing accelerated the malignant transformation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. Mechanistically, ISG12a promoted β-catenin proteasomal degradation by inhibiting the degradation of ubiquitinated Axin, thereby suppressing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, β-catenin was identified as a transcription factor for PD-L1. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ISG12a suppressed expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1, rendering cancer cells sensitive to NK cell-mediated killing. This study reveals a mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of IFN. Some ISGs, as represented by ISG12a, may be useful in cancer therapy and prevention.

Hyperactivation of AKT is associated with many pathological conditions, particularly cancers. Emerging evidence indicates that arginine methylation is involved in modulating AKT signaling pathway. However, whether and how arginine methylation directly regulates AKT kinase activity remain unknown. Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), but not other PRMTs, promotes AKT activation by catalyzing symmetric dimethylation of AKT1 at arginine 391 (R391). Mechanistically, AKT1-R391 methylation cooperates with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) to relieve the pleckstrin homology (PH)-in conformation, leading to AKT1 membrane translocation and subsequent activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). As a result, deficiency in AKT1-R391 methylation significantly suppresses AKT1 kinase activity and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we show that PRMT5 inhibitor synergizes with AKT inhibitor or chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance cell death. Altogether, our study suggests that R391 methylation is an important step for AKT activation and its oncogenic function.","2021-06-08","2021-07-12 06:46:59","2021-07-12 17:18:24","2021-07-12 06:46:59","3444","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Methylation Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;methylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IX8SM6PI/Yin et al. - 2021 - PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation activates AKT .pdf","","27; South Carolina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that the tumor suppressor p53 cooperates with Smad proteins, which are TGF-β signal transducers, to selectively activate plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) transcription. p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 in the PAI-1 promoter to recruit histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and enhance histone H3 acetylation, resulting in transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene. Importantly, p53 is required for TGF-β-induced cytostasis and PAI-1 is involved in the cytostatic activity of TGF-β in several cell lines. Our results suggest that p53 enhances TGF-β-induced cytostatic effects by activating PAI-1 transcription, and the functional switching of TGF-β is partially caused by p53 mutation or p53 inactivation during cancer progression.

PBP suppressed TGF-β-mediated cell migration, PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter gene activation, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in various cell types. Furthermore, PBP abolished TGF-β-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression, in addition to the induction of vimentin expression and N-cadherin and fibronectin upregulation, thus blocking TGF-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition in A549 and NMuMG cells. However, this inhibition was not observed with other congeners such as tribromophenol and triiodophenol. TGF-β superfamily members play key roles in regulating various biological processes including cell proliferation and migration as well as cancer development and progression. The results of this in vitro study provide a basis for studies on the detailed relationship between PBP and modulation of TGF-β signalling.

STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in SSc in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Expression profiling and functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that STAT3 activation is mediated by the combined action of JAK, SRC, c-ABL, and JNK kinases. STAT3-deficient fibroblasts are less sensitive to the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ. Fibroblast-specific knockout of STAT3, or its pharmacological inhibition, ameliorate skin fibrosis in experimental mouse models. STAT3 thus integrates several profibrotic signals and might be a core mediator of fibrosis.

Here, we report that insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue of LDKO mice is also impaired but is restored in LTKO mice in conjunction with normal suppression of HGP by insulin. To establish the mechanism by which white adipose tissue insulin signaling and HGP was regulated by hepatic FoxO1, we identified putative hepatokines—including excess follistatin (Fst)—that were dysregulated in LDKO mice but normalized in LTKO mice. Knockdown of hepatic Fst in the LDKO mouse liver restored glucose tolerance, white adipose tissue insulin signaling and the suppression of HGP by insulin; however, the expression of Fst in the liver of healthy LTKO mice had the opposite effect. Of potential clinical significance, knockdown of Fst also improved glucose tolerance in high-fat-fed obese mice, and the level of serum Fst was reduced in parallel with glycated hemoglobin in obese individuals with diabetes who underwent therapeutic gastric bypass surgery.

We show that Parp7 mono-ADP-ribosylates agonist-bound AR, and that ADP-ribosyl-cysteines within the N-terminal domain mediate recruitment of the E3 ligase Dtx3L/Parp9.

We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the roles of IGF-1 signaling during agonist-induced cardiac fibrosis and evaluated the molecular mechanisms in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Using an experimental model of cardiac fibrosis with angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE) infusion, we found severe interstitial fibrosis in the AngII/PE infused myofibroblast-specific IGF-1R knockout mice compared to the wild-type mice. In contrast, low-dose IGF-1 infusion markedly attenuated AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and differentiation.

We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. While TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an <i>Mtor S2159A</i> knock-in allele (<i>Mtor</i><sup>A/A</sup>) using <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promote mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 co-immunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal crosstalk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings.</p>","2021-07-07","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","2021-07-13 04:33:02","","","0","0","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 34245780","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XLIJMBCF/Tooley et al. - 2021 - The innate immune kinase TBK1 directly increases m.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4DC8B9HT/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245780","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we show that in lung cancer cells, as such in hematopoietic cells, Vav1 interacts with the Spleen Tyrosine Kinase, Syk. Likewise, Syk interacts with β-catenin and, together with Vav1, regulates the phosphorylation status of β-catenin.

In addition, the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP axis is known to play an important role in maintaining endothelial barrier function. However, the potential role of protein kinase G-Iα (PKG-Iα) in this protective process is unresolved and was the focus of our study. We describe here a novel mechanism regulating PDE3A activity which involves a protein kinase G-Iα (PKG-Iα)-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of PDE3A at Serine (S)654. We also show that this phosphorylation is critical for maintaining intracellular cAMP levels in the pulmonary endothelium and endothelial barrier integrity. In an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by challenging mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an increase in PDE3 activity and a decrease in cAMP levels in lung tissue was associated with reduced PKG activity upon PKG-Iα nitration at tyrosine (Y)247. The peroxynitrite scavenger manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP) prevented this increase in PDE3 activity in LPS-exposed lungs. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of PDE3A to replace S654 with alanine yielded a mutant protein that was insensitive to PKG-dependent regulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel functional link between nitrosative stress induced by LPS during ALI and the downregulation of barrier-protective intracellular cAMP levels. Our data also provide new evidence that PKG-Iα is critical for endothelial barrier maintenance, and that preservation of its catalytic activity may be efficacious in ALI therapy.","2021-07-10","2021-07-14 07:57:11","2021-07-14 07:57:11","2021-07-14 07:57:11","100946","","","","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","Nitration of protein kinase G-Iα modulates cyclic nucleotide crosstalk via phosphodiesterase 3A","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZHUIA2TA/S0021925821007468.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHM is mediated by activation-induced deaminase (AID), occurs at a million times higher frequency than other mutations in the mammalian genome, and is largely restricted to the variable (V) and switch (S) regions of Ig genes. Using the Ramos human Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, we find that H3K79me2/3 and its methyltransferase Dot1L are more abundant on the V region than on the constant (C) region, which does not undergo mutation. In primary naïve mouse B cells examined ex vivo, the H3K79me2/3 modification appears constitutively in the donor Sμ and is inducible in the recipient Sγ1 upon CSR stimulation. Knockout and inhibition of Dot1L in Ramos cells significantly reduces V region mutation and the abundance of H3K79me2/3 on the V region and is associated with a decrease of polymerase II (Pol II) and its S2 phosphorylated form at the IgH locus. Knockout of Dot1L also decreases the abundance of BRD4 and CDK9 (a subunit of the P-TEFb complex) on the V region, and this is accompanied by decreased nascent transcripts throughout the IgH gene. Treatment with JQ1 (inhibitor of BRD4) or DRB (inhibitor of CDK9) decreases SHM and the abundance of Pol II S2P at the IgH locus. Since all these factors play a role in transcription elongation, our studies reinforce the idea that the chromatin context and dynamics of transcription are critical for SHM.","2021-07-20","2021-07-16 14:07:51","2021-07-16 14:07:51","2021-07-16 14:07:51","","","29","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 34253616","","; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/4RZVKJEJ/e2104013118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253616","","Dot1L; H3K79me; immunoglobulin variable (V) region; somatic hypermutation (SHM); transcription elongation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further analyses identiﬁed acute increases in c-MET activity following treatment with MEK inhibitors in KRASMT CRC models, which was demonstrated to promote JAK1/ 2-STAT3-mediated resistance. Furthermore, activation of c-MET following MEK inhibition was found to be due to inhibition of the ERK-dependent metalloprotease ADAM17, which normally inhibits c-MET signaling by promoting shedding of its endogenous antagonist, soluble ‘‘decoy’’ MET.

Here, we report examination of the dynamic subcellular localization of all three RLRs within the intracellular response to dsRNA and RNA virus infection. Observations from high resolution biochemical fractionation and electron microscopy, coupled with analysis of protein interactions and IRF3 activation, show that, in resting cells, microsome but not mitochondrial fractions harbor the central components to initiate innate immune signaling. LGP2 interacts with MAVS in microsomes, blocking the RIG-I/MAVS interaction. Remarkably, in response to dsRNA treatment or RNA virus infection, LGP2 is rapidly released from MAVS and redistributed to mitochondria, temporally correlating with IRF3 activation. We reveal that IRF3 activation does not take place on mitochondria but instead occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes.

A ternary complex comprised of SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 (SHOC2 complex) functions as a RAF S259 holophosphatase and gain-of-function mutations in SHOC2, MRAS, and PP1 that promote complex formation are found in Noonan syndrome. Here we show that SHOC2 complex-mediated S259 RAF dephosphorylation is critically required for growth factor-induced RAF heterodimerization as well as for MEK dissociation from BRAF. We also uncover SHOC2-independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK pathway activation that rely on N-region phosphorylation of CRAF. In DLD-1 cells stimulated with EGF, SHOC2 function is essential for a rapid transient phase of ERK activation, but is not required for a slow, sustained phase that is instead driven by palmitoylated H/N-RAS proteins and CRAF. Whereas redundant SHOC2-dependent and -independent mechanisms of RAF and ERK activation make SHOC2 dispensable for proliferation in 2D, KRAS mutant cells preferentially rely on SHOC2 for ERK signaling under anchorage-independent conditions.

Collectively, the novel autophagy-dependent mode of FOXM1 suppression by STL427944 validates a unique pathway to overcome tumor chemoresistance and improve the efficacy of treatment with conventional cancer drugs.","2021-07-14","2021-08-28 19:24:46","2021-08-28 19:24:46","2021-08-28 19:24:46","1-13","","7","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Oncogenes;Target identification Subject_term_id: oncogenes;target-identification","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/E67TSQBS/Chesnokov et al. - 2021 - Novel FOXM1 inhibitor identified via gene network .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs.

Here, we show that Akt activation is a convergent feature of acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, across a spectrum of diverse, established upstream resistance mechanisms. Combined treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and Akt inhibitor causes apoptosis and synergistic growth inhibition in multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer models. Moreover, phospho-Akt levels are increased in most clinical specimens obtained from EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer patients with acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance.

Belvarafenib induced ARAF mutant dimers, and dimers containing mutant ARAF were active in the presence of inhibitor. ARAF mutations may serve as a general resistance mechanism for RAF dimer inhibitors as the mutants exhibit reduced sensitivity to a panel of type II RAF inhibitors. The combination of RAF plus MEK inhibition may be used to delay ARAF-driven resistance and suggests a rational combination for clinical use.

Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

Somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have emerged as promising agents for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS-mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. Here, we demonstrate that the selective pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-632 suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. Our analysis using RNAi and TAK-632 in preclinical models reveals that the MAPK pathway of NRAS-mutated melanoma cells is highly dependent on RAF. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. As a result, TAK-632 demonstrates potent antiproliferative effects both on NRAS-mutated melanoma cells and BRAF-mutated melanoma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors through NRAS mutation or BRAF truncation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor TAK-733 exhibits synergistic antiproliferative effects on these cells. Our findings characterize the unique features of TAK-632 as a pan-RAF inhibitor and provide rationale for its further investigation in NRAS-mutated melanoma and a subset of BRAF-mutated melanomas refractory to BRAF inhibitors.

Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of these cells.

Paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells showed higher expression of MDR1 and HSF1. Depletion of HSF1 decreased mdr1 expression at mRNA level, and HSF1 directly interacted with the promoter site of mdr1, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator of MDR1. Phosphorylation of Ser303/307, which was involved in protein stability of HSF1 by FBXW7-mediated degradation, was found to be important for transcriptional activation of mdr1. Drug-resistant cells showed decreased expression of FBXW7, which was mediated by the activation of ERK1/2, thus indicating that over-activation of ERK1/2 in drug-resistant cells decreased FBXW7 protein stability, which finally inhibited protein degradation of pHSF1 at Ser303/307. There was a positive correlation between immunofluorescence data of pHSF1 at Ser303/307 and MDR1 in carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors and human lung cancers.

The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of Mdm2, which impedes Mdm2 autoubiquitination and degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization of Mdm2. MARCH7 also promotes Mdm2-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of p53. Furthermore, MARCH7 is able to regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and tumorigenesis via a p53-dependent mechanism. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of Mdm2 and reveal MARCH7 as an important regulator of the Mdm2?p53 pathway.","2018-02-01","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","2021-08-30 09:20:31","305-319","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IB4MFKRK/2018 - Regulation of the Mdm2–p53 pathway by the ubiquiti.pdf","","","MARCH7; Mdm2; p53; ubiquitination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy activation and the development of hypoxic regions within the tumors are known to promote cancer cell resistance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy and hypoxia on the taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol induced apoptosis after 16 h of incubation, and that hypoxia protected MDA-MB-231 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. In parallel, taxol induced autophagy activation already after 2 h of incubation both under normoxia and hypoxia. Autophagy activation after taxol exposure was shown to be a protective mechanism against taxol-induced cell death both under normoxia and hypoxia. However, at longer incubation time, the autophagic process reached a saturation point under normoxia leading to cell death, whereas under hypoxia, autophagy flow still correctly took place allowing the cells to survive. Autophagy induction is induced after taxol exposure via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, which is more important in cells exposed to hypoxia. Taxol also induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and phosphorylation of its substrates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and BCL2-like 1 (BclXL) under normoxia and hypoxia very early after taxol exposure. Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation was decreased more importantly under hypoxia after long incubation time. The role of JNK in autophagy and apoptosis induction was studied using siRNAs. The results showed that JNK activation promotes resistance against taxol-induced apoptosis under normoxia and hypoxia without being involved in induction of autophagy. In conclusion, the resistance against taxol-induced cell death observed under hypoxia can be explained by a more effective autophagic flow activated via the classical mTOR pathway and by a mechanism involving JNK, which could be dependent on Bcl2 and BclXL phosphorylation but independent of JNK-induced autophagy activation.","2013-05","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","2021-08-30 09:37:54","e638-e638","","5","4","","Cell Death Dis","Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells","","","","","","","en","2013 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Breast cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;breast-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/554QSFB4/Notte et al. - 2013 - Hypoxia counteracts taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDUUEBQY/cddis2013167.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction &gt;90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.</p>","2015-07-21","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","2021-08-30 16:24:27","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YNHPDB6Z/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VMFKBSNI/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EGFR mutations identify lung cancer patients who can derive benefit from TKIs, but most patients develop resistance to the first-, second-, and third-generation drugs. To explore alternatives to such whack-a-mole strategies, we simulated in patient-derived xenograft models the situation of patients receiving first-line TKIs. Monotherapies comprising approved first-line TKIs were compared to combinations with antibodies specific to EGFR and HER2. We observed uniform and strong superiority of all drug combinations over the respective monotherapies. Prolonged treatments, high TKI dose, and specificity were essential for drug?drug cooperation. Blocking pathways essential for mitosis (e.g., FOXM1), along with downregulation of resistance-conferring receptors (e.g., AXL), might underlie drug cooperation. Thus, upfront treatments using combinations of TKIs and antibodies can prevent emergence of resistance and hence might replace the widely applied sequential treatments utilizing next-generation TKIs.","2021-04-09","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","2021-08-30 16:45:11","e13144","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CYLCPIC2/2021 - Upfront admixing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors pr.pdf","","","EGFR TKIs; first-line therapy; mAbs; NSCLC; resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET. Together, these results provide preclinical evidence for the use of MEK inhibitors in combination with clinical-grade anti-ERBB3 or anti-cMET monoclonal antibodies in metastatic uveal melanoma.

Here, we applied an unbiased, ORF-based screen to identify genetic modifiers of EGFR dependence in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. This approach identified 18 kinase and kinase-related genes whose overexpression can substitute for EGFR in EGFR-dependent PC9 cells, and these genes include seven of nine Src family kinase genes, FGFR1, FGFR2, ITK, NTRK1, NTRK2, MOS, MST1R, and RAF1.

Unbiased gene-expression profiling of cells overexpressing EGFR bypass genes, together with targeted validation studies, reveals EGFR-independent activation of the MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways. Combined inhibition of PI3K-mTOR and MEK restores EGFR dependence in cells expressing each of the 18 EGFR bypass genes.

Here we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells. Loss of EPHA2 reduced the viability of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells harboring EGFRT790M mutations in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and progression in an inducible EGFRL858R+T790M-mutant lung cancer model in vivo. Targeting EPHA2 in erlotinib-resistant cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.

ALW-II-41-27 was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291.

These EGFR-dependent tumors eventually become TKI resistant, and the common secondary T790M mutation accounts for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib. However, the key proapoptotic proteins involved in TKI-induced cell death and other secondary mutations involved in resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis and secondary resistant mutations that affect this process. Methods and Findings To study TKI-induced cell death and mechanisms of resistance, we used lung cancer cell lines (with or without EGFR mutations), Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with EGFR mutation constructs, and tumor samples from a gefitinib-resistant patient. Here we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only polypeptide BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11) correlated with gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. The T790M mutation blocked gefitinib-induced up-regulation of BIM and apoptosis. This blockade was overcome by the irreversible TKI CL-387,785. Knockdown of BIM by small interfering RNA was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, from a gefitinib-resistant patient carrying the activating L858R mutation, we identified a novel secondary resistant mutation, L747S in cis to the activating mutation, which attenuated the up-regulation of BIM and reduced apoptosis. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that BIM is involved in TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells and that both attenuation of the up-regulation of BIM and resistance to gefitinib-induced apoptosis are seen in models that contain the common EGFR T790M and the novel L747S secondary resistance mutations. These findings also suggest that induction of BIM may have a role in the treatment of TKI-resistant tumors.","2007-10-30","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","2021-08-30 17:00:18","e315","","10","4","","PLOS Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/F6XYEEGA/Costa et al. - 2007 - BIM Mediates EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induce.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; EGFR signaling; Lung and intrathoracic tumors; Mutation detection; Non-small cell lung cancer; Transfection; Tyrosine kinases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the in vitro gefitinib response of four EGFR double mutants identified in untreated patients, including Q787R+L858R, E709A+G719C, T790M+L858R, and H870R+L858R. The phosphorylation profiles of EGFR and downstream effectors AKT, STAT3/5, and ERK1/2 were compared by immunoblot analyses among the single and double mutants transfected into H358 cells. Results showed that mutants responded to in vitro gefitinib treatment with different sensitivities. The G719C and L858R single mutants showed the highest gefitinib sensitivity compared with the corresponding coexisting single mutants E709A, Q787R, H870R, and T790M. The double mutants E709A+G719C, Q787R+L858R, and H870R+L858R showed attenuated responses to gefitinib in the EGFR and downstream effector phosphorylation profiles compared with G719C or L858R alone. T790M+L858R showed strong resistance to gefitinib. Clinically, the patient whose tumor contained H870R+L858R showed tumor stabilization by 250 mg oral gefitinib daily but cerebral metastasis developed 6 months later. Correlation with the in vitro phosphorylation profile of H870R+L858R suggested that treatment failure was probably due to inadequate suppression of EGFR signaling by the drug level attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid at the given oral dosage.

Here, using genetically knocked out EGFR and TKI-resistant lung cancer cells, we show that loss of wild-type EGFR attenuates cell proliferation, migration and 3D-spheroid formation, whereas loss of mutant EGFR or resistance to TKIs reinforces those processes. Consistently, disruption of wild-type EGFR leads to suppression of HER2/HER3, while mutant EGFR ablation or resistance to TKIs increases HER2/HER3 expression, compensating for EGFR loss. Furthermore, HER2/HER3 nuclear translocation mediates overexpression of cyclin D1, leading to tumor cell survival and drug resistance.

Here, we present a dual mechanism of AKT regulation by the ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1). We show that in cells expressing high levels of EGFR, ERRF1 inhibits growth and enhances responses to chemotherapy. This is mediated in part through the negative regulation of AKT signaling by direct ERRFI1-dependent inhibition of EGFR. In cells expressing low levels of EGFR, ERRFI1 positively modulates AKT signaling by interfering with the interaction of the inactivating phosphatase PHLPP with AKT, thereby promoting cell growth and chemotherapy desensitization. These observations broaden our understanding of chemotherapy response and have important implications for the selection of targeted therapies in a cell context-dependent manner. EGFR inhibition can only sensitize EGFR-high cells for chemotherapy, while AKT inhibition increases chemosensitivity in EGFR-low cells. By understanding these mechanisms, we can take advantage of the cellular context to individualize antineoplastic therapy. Finally, our data also suggest targeting of EFFRI1 in EGFR-low cancer as a promising therapeutic approach.","2018-03-01","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","2021-08-30 17:04:30","e44767","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A3FZ2EF4/2018 - Differential roles of ERRFI1 in EGFR and AKT pathw.pdf","","","AKT; AKT inhibitor; EGFR; ERRFI1; PHLPP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore, an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-α, E545K, and H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses, suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-α.

We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner.

This study revealed that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) contributes to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells. We observed that KLF4 was overexpressed in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells and tissues. Knockdown of KLF4 increased tumorigenic properties in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines without c-Met overexpression, but it reduced tumorigenic properties and increased gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with c-Met overexpression, whereas overexpression of KLF4 reduced gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that KLF4 contributed to the formation of gefitinib resistance in c-Met-overexpressing NSCLC cells by inhibiting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins under gefitinib treatment and activating the c-Met/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing the inhibition of β-catenin on phosphorylation of c-Met to prevent blockade by gefitinib.

EPH receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and modulate a diverse range of developmental processes and human diseases. However, the role of C1GALT1 in the signaling of EPH receptors remains largely overlooked. Here, we showed that C1GALT1 high expression in gastric adenocarcinomas correlated with adverse clinicopathologic features and is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. Silencing or loss of C1GALT1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, as well as increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil in AGS and MKN45 cells. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis showed that C1GALT1 depletion suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 induced by soluble Ephrin A1-Fc. O-glycans on EPHA2 were modified by C1GALT1 and both S277A and T429A mutants, which are O-glycosites on EPHA2, dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Y588, suggesting that not only overall O-glycan structures but also site-specific O-glycosylation can regulate EPHA2 activity. Furthermore, depletion of C1GALT1 decreased Ephrin A1-Fc induced migration and reduced Ephrin A1 binding to cell surfaces. The effects of C1GALT1 knockdown or knockout on cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo were phenocopied by EPHA2 knockdown in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that C1GALT1 promotes phosphorylation of EPHA2 and enhances soluble Ephrin A1-mediated migration primarily by modifying EPHA2 O-glycosylation.

Heterogeneity along the EMT spectrum is observed between and within tumors. To develop effective therapeutics, a mechanistic understanding of how EMT affects the molecular requirements for proliferation is needed. We found that although cells use phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) for proliferation in both the epithelial and mesenchymal states, EMT rewires the mechanism of PI3K pathway activation. In epithelial cells, autocrine ERBB3 activation maintains PI3K signaling, whereas after EMT, downregulation of ERBB3 disrupts autocrine signaling to PI3K. Loss of ERBB3 leads to reduced serum-independent proliferation after EMT that can be rescued through reactivation of PI3K by enhanced signaling from p110α, ERBB3 reexpression, or growth factor stimulation. In vivo, we demonstrate that PIK3CA expression is upregulated in mesenchymal tumors with low levels of ERBB3. This study defines how ERBB3 downregulation after EMT affects PI3K-dependent proliferation. Significance: This study describes a mechanism through which EMT transition alters the proliferative potential of cells by modulating ERBB3 expression. Furthermore, it demonstrates the potential for multiple molecular routes to drive proliferation in different cell states, illustrating how changes in EMT status can rewire signaling upstream of cell proliferation.

In this present study, we report that SH003, an herbal formulation, induces ER stress via PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling in GC. SH003-mediated ER stress inhibits G9a, a histone methyltransferase, by reducing STAT3 phosphorylation and activates autophagy, indicating to the dissociation of Beclin-1 and autophagy initiation from Bcl-2/Beclin-1 complex. However, the inhibition of PERK and CHOP inhibited SH003-induced cell death and autophagy activation. Moreover, targeting autophagy using specific siRNAs of LC3B or p62 or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA also inhibited SH003-induced cell death in GC. Interestingly, SH003 induces BNIP3-mediated autophagic cell death under hypoxia than normoxia in GC.

A KRAS-specific DARPin fused to the VHL E3 ligase is compared to a pan-RAS intracellular single domain antibody (iDAb) fused to the UBOX domain of the CHIP E3 ligase.

MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2’s predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS’s unique effector specificity for SHOC2–PP1.

RAS protein coclustering is mainly mediated by membrane association-facilitated interactions (MAFIs). Using the RAS–RBD (CRAF RAS binding domain) interaction as a model system, we showed that MAFI alone is not sufficient to induce RBD-mediated RAS inhibition. Surprisingly, we discovered that high-affinity membrane-targeted RAS binding proteins inhibit RAS activity and deplete RAS proteins through an autophagosome–lysosome-mediated degradation pathway. Our results provide a mechanism for regulating RAS activity and protein levels, a more detailed understanding of which should lead to therapeutic strategies for inhibiting and depleting oncogenic RAS proteins.</p>","2020-05-18","2021-08-31 17:23:01","2021-09-07 20:45:06","2021-08-31 17:23:01","","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","ISBN: 9782000848110 Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32424096","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EWN4T88E/Li et al. - 2020 - Analysis of RAS protein interactions in living cel.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424096","_company","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","2021-08-31 17:31:28","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/W57Z9ILH/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LPS-induced IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation as well as the expressions of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-6, IL-8, TNF- α, IL-1β, MCP-1, MMP-9, COX-2 and iNOS, were all suppressed by DKK-1 and LGK974 in a dose-dependent manner. The suppressive effects of LGK974 on NF-κB, IκB, and pro-inflammatory gene expression were rescued by ectopic expression of β-catenin, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of LGK974 is mediated by modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and not by unrelated side effects. When Wnt recombinant proteins were treated to cells, Wnt3a and Wnt5a significantly induced pro-inflammatory gene expressions, while Wnt7a and Wnt10b showed little effects. It was also found that Wnt3a and Wnt5a expressions were significantly induced by LPS treatment.

Additionally, Akt signaling has been linked to resistance to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in sarcoma, further demonstrating the role of Akt in tumor survival. This suggests targeting components of the PI3K/Akt pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the in vitro activity of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Buparlisib inhibited activation of Akt and signaling molecules downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) in Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Anti-proliferative effects were observed in both anchorage dependent and independent conditions and apoptosis was induced within 24 hours of drug treatment. Buparlisib demonstrated cytotoxicity as a single agent, but was found to be more effective when used in combination. Synergy was observed when buparlisib was combined with the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The addition of NVP-AEW541 also further reduced phospho-Akt levels and more potently induced apoptosis compared to buparlisib treatment alone. Additionally, the combination of buparlisib with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib resulted in synergy in sarcoma cell lines possessing MAPK pathway mutations.

Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, is importantly recognized as intracellular remodeling mechanism of cellular organelles during muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation.

Immunosuppression likely contributes to lung cancer, because drugs that inhibit immune checkpoints like PD-1 and PD-L1 have clinical benefit. Here, we show that activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway tightly regulates PD-L1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Both oncogenic and IFNγ-mediated induction of PD-L1 was dependent on mTOR. In human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, membranous expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with mTOR activation. These data suggest that oncogenic activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway promotes immune escape by driving expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer where an mTOR inhibitor combined with a PD-1 antibody decreased tumor growth, increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, and decreased regulatory T cells.

Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the ‘precision medicine’ paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2–6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7–14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher ‘matching score’, was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.","2019-05","2021-08-31 19:59:55","2021-08-31 19:59:55","2021-08-31 19:59:55","744-750","","5","25","","Nat Med","Molecular profiling of cancer patients enables personalized combination therapy","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer genomics;Clinical trials;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: cancer-genomics;clinical-trials;targeted-therapies","<p><strong>Therapy and Matching:</strong></p> <p>A ""treatment"" was considered matched if at least one agent in the treatment regimen targeted at least one aberration, or pathway component alrered in a patient's molecular profile.</p>","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IUFAFBAJ/Sicklick et al. - 2019 - Molecular profiling of cancer patients enables per.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XJUS7CUV/s41591-019-0407-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NTRK-rearranged cancers have been identified in several cancer types, such as glioblastoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Although there are currently no clinically approved inhibitors that target NTRK1, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as entrectinib and LOXO-101, are in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to identify potential mechanisms of resistance to NTRK inhibitors and find potential therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance. We examined the sensitivity of TPM3-NTRK1-transformed Ba/F3 cells and TPM3-NTRK1-harboring KM12 cells to multiple NTRK inhibitors. Acquired NTRK inhibitor-resistant mutations were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3-TPM3-NTRK1 cells or by the establishment of NTRK-TKI-resistant cells from KM12 cells continuously treated with NTRK-TKIs. We identified multiple novel NTRK-TKI resistance mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain, including G595R, and insulin growth factor receptor type 1 (IGF1R) bypass pathway-mediated resistance. After identifying the resistance mechanisms, we performed drug screening with small-molecule inhibitors to overcome the resistance. As a result, we found that ponatinib and nintedanib effectively inhibited the survival of TPM3-NTRK1-G667C but not G595R mutants, both of which showed resistance to entrectinib or larotrectinib (LOXO-101). Furthermore, cabozantinib with an IGF1R inhibitor such as OSI-906 could overcome bypass pathway-mediated resistance. We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to NTRK inhibitors in cancer with NTRK1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.

Because the development of drug resistance is inevitable, it would be helpful to determine the mechanisms of entrectinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged tumor model so that future therapeutic strategies can be developed. Here, we characterized the molecular basis of resistance in entrectinib-resistant ROS1-rearranged HCC78 cells (HCC78ER cells). These cells were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and genetic profiling, which revealed the acquisition of KRAS G12C and the amplification of KRAS and FGF3. However, there were no secondary mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain. We also found that sustained ERK activation was involved in entrectinib resistance, and that combined treatment with selumetinib resensitized HCC78ER cells to entrectinib in cell viability and colony formation assays. Our data suggest that activation of the RAS signaling pathway can cause entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, and is unlikely to be overcome by sequential single agent ROS1-targeting strategies against such tumors.

Approximately 15% of tumors harboring MET exon14 skipping have concurrent MET amplification. Experimental Design Merestinib is a type II MET kinase inhibitor. Emibetuzumab, a bivalent anti-MET antibody, internalizes MET receptor. Each single agent and the combination were evaluated in the Hs746t gastric cancer line bearing MET exon14 skipping and MET amplification. Results Merestinib inhibited Hs746t cell proliferation (IC50=34 nM) and totally eliminated pMET at 100nM. Emibetuzumab showed little anti-proliferative activity against Hs746t cells (IC50>100nM), did not reduce pMET, and slightly reduced cell surface MET. In the Hs746t xenograft model, dose dependent differences in durability of response were seen with merestinib including durable tumor regression (91.8%) at 12 mg/kg qd. Emibetuzumab treatment (10mg/kg qw) provided transient tumor regression (37.7%), but tumors re-grew while on treatment. Concurrent combination of merestinib (6 mg/kg qd) and emibetuzumab resulted in 85% tumor regression, while a sequential combination (initiating merestinib first) resulted in longer duration of treatment response. Conclusions Data in this study support a clinical evaluation of merestinib in patients with MET exon 14 skipping (NCT02920996). As a type II MET kinase inhibitor, merestinib may provide a therapeutic option to treatment naïve patients or to patients who progress on type I MET inhibitor treatment.

Aberrant activation of c-Met resulting from MET amplification and c-Met overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome in multiple malignancies underscoring the importance of c-Met signaling in cancer progression. Several c-Met inhibitors have advanced to the clinic; however, the development of inhibitory c-Met-directed therapeutic antibodies has been hampered by inherent agonistic activity. Method: We generated and tested a bivalent anti-c-Met monoclonal antibody ABT-700 in vitro for binding potency and antagonistic activity and in vivo for antitumor efficacy in human tumor xenografts. Human cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissue microarrays were examined for MET amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: ABT-700 exhibits a distinctive ability to block both HGF-independent constitutive c-Met signaling and HGF-dependent activation of c-Met. Cancer cells addicted to the constitutively activated c-Met signaling driven by MET amplification undergo apoptosis upon exposure to ABT-700. ABT-700 induces tumor regression and tumor growth delay in preclinical tumor models of gastric and lung cancers harboring amplified MET. ABT-700 in combination with chemotherapeutics also shows additive antitumor effect. Amplification of MET in human cancer tissues can be identified by FISH.

One recognized resistance mechanism occurs through activation of bypass signaling via the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET pathway. INC-280 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET. We sought to demonstrate the activity of INC-280 on select NSCLC cell lines both as a single agent and in combination with erlotinib using exogenous HGF to simulate MET up-regulation. Methods Four NSCLC cell lines (HCC827, PC9, H1666, and H358) were treated with either single-agent INC-280 or in combination with erlotinib with or without HGF. The activity of the drug treatments was measured by cell viability assays. Immunoblotting was used to monitor expression of EGFR/pEGFR, MET/pMET, GAB1/pGAB1, AKT/pAKT, and ERK/pERK as well as markers of apoptosis (PARP and capase-3 cleavage) in H1666, HCC827, and PC9. Results As a single agent, INC-280 showed minimal cytotoxicity despite potent inhibition of MET kinase activity at concentrations as low as 10 nM. Addition of HGF prevented erlotinib-induced cell death. The addition of INC280 to HGF-mediated erlotinib-resistant models restored erlotinib sensitivity for all cell lines tested, associated with cleavage of both PARP and caspase-3. In these models, INC-280 treatment was sufficient to restore erlotinib-induced inhibition of MET, GAB1, AKT, and ERK in the presence of HGF. Conclusion Although the MET inhibitor INC-280 alone had no discernible effect on cell growth, it was able to restore sensitivity to erlotinib and promote apoptosis in NSCLC models rendered erlotinib resistant by HGF. These data provide a preclinical rationale for an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of erlotinib plus INC-280 in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.","2017-05-01","2021-09-07 14:45:16","2021-09-07 14:45:16","2021-09-07 14:45:16","281-285","","3","18","","Clinical Lung Cancer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I97D2CBU/Lara et al. - 2017 - Preclinical Evaluation of MET Inhibitor INC-280 Wi.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EHYIMHB9/S1525730416303606.html","","","AKT; Acquired resistance; Combination therapy; EGFR mutant; ERK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an ongoing phase I trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ROS1 fusions; however, cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in ROS1. Thus, understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required. Experimental Design: The sensitivity of CD74–ROS1–transformed Ba/F3 cells to multiple ALK inhibitors was examined. Acquired ROS1 inhibitor–resistant mutations in CD74–ROS1 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3 cells. To overcome the resistance mutation, we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials. The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the CD74–ROS1–mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74–ROS1. Results: We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain, including the G2032R mutation. As the result of high-throughput drug screening, we found that the cMET/RET/VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184) effectively inhibited the survival of CD74–ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations. Conclusions: We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.

About 14% of NSCLCs harbor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite remarkable progress in treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), only 5% of patients achieve tumor reduction >90%. The limited primary responses are attributed partly to drug resistance inherent in the tumor cells before therapy begins. Recent reports showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is an important determinant of this innate drug resistance. In contrast, we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition promotes innate drug resistance despite blockade of RTK activity in NSCLC cells. EGFR TKIs decrease both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt protein kinase pathways for a short time, after which the Ras/MAPK pathway becomes reactivated. Akt inhibition selectively blocks the transcriptional activation of Ets-1, which inhibits its target gene, dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a negative regulator specific for ERK1/2. As a result, ERK1/2 is activated. Furthermore, elevated c-Src stimulates Ras GTP-loading and activates Raf and MEK kinases. These observations suggest that not only ERK1/2 but also Akt activity is essential to maintain Ets-1 in an active state. Therefore, despite high levels of ERK1/2, Ets-1 target genes including DUSP6 and cyclins D1, D3, and E2 remain suppressed by Akt inhibition. Reduction of DUSP6 in combination with elevated c-Src renews activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which enhances cell survival by accelerating Bim protein turnover. Thus, EGFR TKIs evoke innate drug resistance by preventing Akt activity and inactivating Ets-1 function in NSCLC cells.","2015-07-21","2021-09-07 20:14:13","2021-09-07 20:14:13","2021-09-07 20:14:13","E3855-E3863","","29","112","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: PNAS Plus PMID: 26150526","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HP2KSHVK/Phuchareon et al. - 2015 - EGFR inhibition evokes innate drug resistance in l.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5G3WE4YT/E3855.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150526","","EGFR inhibition; ERK1/2 paradoxical activation; innate drug resistance; nonsmall cell lung cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although entrectinib is effective in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastases that express NTRK1 fusion proteins, acquired resistance inevitably results in recurrence. The CNS is a sanctuary for targeted drugs; however, the mechanism by which CNS metastases become entrectinib-resistant remains elusive and must be clarified to develop better therapeutics. Experimental Design: The entrectinib-resistant cell line KM12SM-ER was developed by continuous treatment with entrectinib in the brain metastasis–mimicking model inoculated with the entrectinib-sensitive human colon cancer cell line KM12SM, which harbors the TPM3-NTRK1 gene fusion. The mechanism of entrectinib resistance in KM12SM-ER cells was examined by next-generation sequencing. Compounds that overcame entrectinib resistance were screened from a library of 122 kinase inhibitors. Results: KM12SM-ER cells, which showed moderate resistance to entrectinib in vitro, had acquired the G667C mutation in NTRK1. The kinase inhibitor foretinib inhibited TRK-A phosphorylation and the viability of KM12SM-ER cells bearing the NTRK1-G667C mutation in vitro. Moreover, foretinib markedly inhibited the progression of entrectinib-refractory KM12SM-ER–derived liver metastases and brain tumors in animal models, predominantly through inhibition of TRK-A phosphorylation. Conclusions: These results suggest that foretinib may be effective in overcoming entrectinib resistance associated with the NTRK1-G667C mutation in NTRK1 fusion–positive tumors in various organs, including the brain, and provide a rationale for clinical trials of foretinib in cancer patients with entrectinib-resistant tumors harboring the NTRK1-G667C mutation, including patients with brain metastases.

We first tested acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and showed that treatment with GCN2 inhibitors rendered ALL cells sensitive to ASNase by preventing the induction of ASNS, resulting in reduced levels of de novo protein synthesis. Comprehensive gene-expression profiling revealed that combined treatment with ASNase and GCN2 inhibitors induced the stress-activated MAPK pathway, thereby triggering apoptosis. By using cell-panel analyses, we also showed that acute myelogenous leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells were highly sensitive to the combined treatment. Notably, basal ASNS expression at protein levels was significantly correlated with sensitivity to combined treatment.

Although the segregation of RNA into phase-separated condensates broadly affects RNA metabolism3,4, whether and how specific RNAs use phase separation to regulate interacting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and the phenotypic consequences of such regulatory interactions, are poorly understood. Here we show that RNA-driven phase separation is a key mechanism through which a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) controls the activity of RBPs and maintains genomic stability in mammalian cells. The lncRNA NORAD prevents aberrant mitosis by inhibiting Pumilio (PUM) proteins5–8. We show that NORAD can out-compete thousands of other PUM-binding transcripts to inhibit PUM by nucleating the formation of phase-separated PUM condensates, termed NP bodies. Dual mechanisms of PUM recruitment, involving multivalent PUM–NORAD and PUM–PUM interactions, enable NORAD to competitively sequester a super-stoichiometric amount of PUM in NP bodies. Disruption of NORAD-driven PUM phase separation leads to PUM hyperactivity and genome instability that is rescued by synthetic RNAs that induce the formation of PUM condensates. These results reveal a mechanism by which RNA-driven phase separation can regulate RBP activity and identify an essential role for this process in genome maintenance. The repetitive sequence architecture of NORAD and other lncRNAs9–11 suggests that phase separation may be a widely used mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation.","2021-07","2021-09-11 06:40:37","2021-09-11 06:40:37","2021-09-11 06:40:37","303-308","","7866","595","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7866 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Chromosomes;Genomic instability;Intrinsically disordered proteins;Long non-coding RNAs;RNA Subject_term_id: chromosomes;genomic-instability;intrinsically-disordered-proteins;long-non-coding-rnas;rna","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6DNWP5HX/Elguindy and Mendell - 2021 - NORAD-induced Pumilio phase separation is required.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/A4693YJ7/s41586-021-03633-w.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In conditions of leucine sufficiency, SAR1B binds to leucine, undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from GATOR2, which results in mTORC1 activation. SAR1B–GATOR2–mTORC1 signalling is conserved in nematodes and has a role in the regulation of lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that SAR1B deficiency correlates with the development of lung cancer.

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational–experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to osmotic stress, as well as by signals acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For proper adaptation, the action of these kinases must be coordinated. To identify second messengers of stress adaptation, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics profiling analysis, quantifying nearly 300 metabolites in the yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the MAPK Hog1. Ectopic addition of these BCAA derivatives promotes phosphorylation of the G protein α subunit and dampens G protein-dependent transcription, similar to that seen in response to osmotic stress. Conversely, genetic ablation of Hog1 activity or the BCAA-regulatory enzymes leads to diminished phosphorylation of Gα and increased transcription.

Here we show that vesicular RANK, which is secreted from the maturing osteoclasts, binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signalling, which activates Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). The proline-rich motif in the RANKL cytoplasmic tail is required for reverse signalling, and a RANKL(Pro29Ala) point mutation reduces activation of the reverse signalling pathway. The coupling of bone resorption and formation is disrupted in RANKL(Pro29Ala) mutant mice, indicating that osteoblastic RANKL functions as a coupling signal acceptor that recognizes vesicular RANK. RANKL reverse signalling is therefore a potential pharmacological target for avoiding the reduced bone formation associated with inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.","2018-09","2021-09-11 19:05:39","2021-09-11 19:05:44","2021-09-11 19:05:39","195-200","","7722","561","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7722 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Antibody fragment therapy;Extracellular signalling molecules;Osteoporosis Subject_term_id: antibody-fragment-therapy;extracellular-signalling-molecules;osteoporosis","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VT843WNK/Ikebuchi et al. - 2018 - Coupling of bone resorption and formation by RANKL.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ82H54G/s41586-018-0482-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around half of all breast cancers with HER2 overexpression co-express hormone receptors (HR) such as those for estrogen and progesterone. Aberrant signaling through HER2 and other members of the HER-family mediates endocrine-resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer. On the other hand, ERα co-expression has been shown to attenuate the efficiency of anti-HER2 therapies. These findings indicate that HER2 and ERα synergize to escape from both anti-ERα and anti-HER2-targeted therapies. Rationally designed clinical trials that combine endocrine therapy with anti-HER2 agents to interfere with HER2/ERα cross-talk have been conducted. However, the outcome of these trials suggests that novel therapeutic approaches are needed to further improve inhibition of HER2 and other HER-family members in conjunction with a more efficient ERα blockade. Here, we demonstrate that carfilzomib and bortezomib stabilize the HER2-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase BDP1 leading to decreased HER2 autophosphorylation, reduced HER2 activity and subsequently attenuated activation of the PI3K/Akt-pathway, together with blockade of ERα expression. We further observed that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) reverse autophosphorylation and thereby inhibit the activity of constitutively active mutant HER2. We also demonstrate that PIs cause cell death in lapatinib and endocrine-resistant HER2+/ER+ breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that PIs might have the potential to improve the management of HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patients by efficiently disrupting the bi-directional HER2/ERα cross-talk.","2017-09-01","2021-09-11 19:25:04","2021-09-11 19:25:06","2021-09-11 19:25:04","72281-72301","","42","8","","Oncotarget","","","","","","","","eng","cc by","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 29069787 PMCID: PMC5641130","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RPJRXRI9/Thaler et al. - 2017 - Proteasome inhibitors prevent bi-directional HER2.pdf","","","Breast Cancer Therapy; Er+/her2+ Breast Cancer; Proteasome inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation by most RTKs and might provide a common resistance node. We found that combining the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 with a MEKi inhibited the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. PTPN11 knockdown/MEKi treatment had similar effects, whereas expressing SHP099 binding–defective PTPN11 mutants conferred resistance, demonstrating that SHP099 is on-target. SHP099/trametinib was highly efficacious in xenograft and/or genetically engineered models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, lung, and ovarian cancers and in wild-type RAS-expressing triple-negative breast cancer. SHP099 inhibited activation of KRAS mutants with residual GTPase activity, impeded SOS/RAS/MEK/ERK1/2 reactivation in response to MEKi, and blocked ERK1/2-dependent transcriptional programs. We conclude that SHP099/MEKi combinations could have therapeutic utility in multiple malignancies. Significance: MEK inhibitors show limited efficacy as single agents, in part because of the rapid development of adaptive resistance.

By searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2. DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38α MAPK. The activated S6K1 forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response and likely in tumorigenesis. S6K1?Mdm2 interaction presents a route for cells to incorporate the metabolic/energy cues into DNA damage response and links the aging-controlling Mdm2?p53 and mTOR-S6K pathways.","2010-09-01","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2021-09-11 21:55:38","2994-3006","","17","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","embopress.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/3AUSDVCG/2010 - S6K1 is a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2 that conn.pdf","","","Mdm2; p53; nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling; S6K1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How cancer cells bypass inhibition to prevent maximal response to therapy is not understood. Because KRAS(G12C) cycles between an active and inactive conformation4–6, and the inhibitors bind only to the latter, we tested whether isogenic cell populations respond in a non-uniform manner by studying the effect of treatment at a single-cell resolution. Here we report that, shortly after treatment, some cancer cells are sequestered in a quiescent state with low KRAS activity, whereas others bypass this effect to resume proliferation. This rapid divergent response occurs because some quiescent cells produce new KRAS(G12C) in response to suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase output. New KRAS(G12C) is maintained in its active, drug-insensitive state by epidermal growth factor receptor and aurora kinase signalling. Cells without these adaptive changes—or cells in which these changes are pharmacologically inhibited—remain sensitive to drug treatment, because new KRAS(G12C) is either not available or exists in its inactive, drug-sensitive state. The direct targeting of KRAS oncoproteins has been a longstanding objective in precision oncology. Our study uncovers a flexible non-uniform fitness mechanism that enables groups of cells within a population to rapidly bypass the effect of treatment.

Here, we report that selective inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, can impair the proliferation of KRAS-mutant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo using cell line xenografts and primary human tumors. In vitro, sensitivity of KRAS-mutant cells toward the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, is not apparent when cells are grown on plastic in 2D monolayer, but is revealed when cells are grown as 3D multicellular spheroids. This antitumor activity is also observed in vivo in mouse models. Interrogation of the MAPK pathway in SHP099-treated KRAS-mutant cancer models demonstrated similar modulation of p-ERK and DUSP6 transcripts in 2D, 3D, and in vivo, suggesting a MAPK pathway–dependent mechanism and possible non-MAPK pathway–dependent mechanisms in tumor cells or tumor microenvironment for the in vivo efficacy. For the KRASG12C MIAPaCa-2 model, we demonstrate that the efficacy is cancer cell intrinsic as there is minimal antiangiogenic activity by SHP099, and the effects of SHP099 is recapitulated by genetic depletion of SHP2 in cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP099 efficacy in KRAS-mutant models can be recapitulated with RTK inhibitors, suggesting RTK activity is responsible for the SHP2 activation. Taken together, these data reveal that many KRAS-mutant cancers depend on upstream signaling from RTK and SHP2, and provide a new therapeutic framework for treating KRAS-mutant cancers with SHP2 inhibitors.","2019-12-01","2021-09-11 22:13:20","2021-09-11 22:13:20","2021-09-11 22:13:20","2368-2380","","12","18","","Mol Cancer Ther","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mct-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Cancer Biology and Translational Studies PMID: 31439712","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MFSGPQ25/Hao et al. - 2019 - Tumor Intrinsic Efficacy by SHP2 and RTK Inhibitor.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439712","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanistic studies determined that MAPK signaling dependency in epithelial lung cancer cells is due to the scaffold protein interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD), which is directly repressed by ZEB1. Lung tumors in multiple Kras mutant murine models with increased ZEB1 displayed low IL17RD expression, accompanied by MAPK-independent tumor growth and therapeutic resistance to MEK inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 function with miR-200 expression or the histone deacetylase inhibitor mocetinostat sensitized resistant cancer cells to MEK inhibition and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth, showing a promising combinatorial treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. In human lung tumor samples, high ZEB1 and low IL17RD expression correlated with low MAPK signaling, presenting potential markers that predict patient response to MEK inhibitors.","2019-03-13","2021-09-11 22:15:24","2021-09-11 22:15:24","","eaaq1238","","483","11","","Sci Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30867319 PMCID: PMC6878763","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/372MF6DA/Peng et al. - 2019 - ZEB1 suppression sensitizes KRAS mutant cancers to.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867319","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Humans; Mice; Benzamides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epithelial Cells; Lung Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mesoderm; MicroRNAs; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Mutation; Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Pyrimidines; Receptors, Interleukin-17; Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of effective salvage treatments is complicated by the heterogeneity of KIT secondary resistance mutations. Recently, additional mutations that independently activate KIT-downstream signaling have been found in pretreated patients—adding further complexity to the scope of resistance. We collected genotyping data for KIT from tumor samples of pretreated GIST, providing a representative overview on the distribution and incidence of secondary KIT mutations (n = 80). Analyzing next-generation sequencing data of 109 GIST, we found that 18% carried mutations in KIT-downstream signaling intermediates (NF1/2, PTEN, RAS, PIK3CA, TSC1/2, AKT, BRAF) potentially mediating resistance to KIT inhibitors. Notably, we found no apparent other driver mutations in refractory cases that were analyzed by whole exome/genome sequencing (13/109). Using CRISPR/Cas9 methods, we generated a panel of GIST cell lines harboring mutations in KIT, PTEN, KRAS, NF1, and TSC2. We utilized this panel to evaluate sapanisertib, a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, as a salvage strategy. Sapanisertib had potent antiproliferative effects in all cell lines, including those with KIT-downstream mutations. Combinations with KIT or MEK inhibitors completely abrogated GIST-survival signaling and displayed synergistic effects.

Several microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in GISTs and impact KIT expression. Little is known though on KIT-independent targets of KIT-regulating mRNAs. We sought to investigate how miR-494 inhibits GIST proliferation and to identify novel target gene. We used microarray-based gene expression analyses to identify pathways and target genes affected by miR-494. The expressional relationship between survivin and miR-494 was determined in 35 GIST tissues. Cell proliferation assay, FACS analysis, colony formation assay, promoter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) were performed to clarify the roles of survivin in GIST progression. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that miR-494 inhibited GISTs by affecting multiple genes in the cell cycle pathway. Survivin (BIRC5) was a key target of miR-494, and its expression showed an inverse correlation with miR-494 expression in 35 GIST tissues (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = −0.418, p = 0.012). Downregulation of survivin inhibited proliferation and colony formation, and resulted in cell cycle alteration. Induced survivin overexpression relieved miR-494-mediated inhibition of GIST progression. Targeting PI3K effectively suppressed proliferation of GISTs with downregulation of survivin. Survivin also regulated KIT expression at the transcription level. Immunohistochemical analysis using 113 GISTs revealed that survivin expression was significantly correlated with overall survival of GIST patients (p = 0.004). Our findings indicated that miR-494 synergistically suppressed GISTs by concomitantly targeting survivin and KIT.","2018","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2021-09-11 23:17:21","2080-2093","","10","142","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ijc.31235","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/8ABEBK4F/Yun et al. - 2018 - Survivin is a novel transcription regulator of KIT.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U3WCEKVH/ijc.html","","","gastrointestinal stromal tumor; KIT; miR-494; survivin; vertical blockade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mutations in the ERBB2 receptor have recently been reported in breast cancer at diagnosis and also in gastric, colorectal and lung cancer. These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002. Conclusions/Significance Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations. Irreversible ERBB2 inhibitors may offer alternative treatment options for breast cancer and other solid tumor patients harbouring lapatinib resistance mutations. In addition, these inhibitors may be of interest in the scenario of secondary lapatinib resistance.","2011-10-28","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","2021-09-11 23:20:03","e26760","","10","6","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JIQCFJFV/Kancha et al. - 2011 - Differential Sensitivity of ERBB2 Kinase Domain Mu.pdf","","","Cancer treatment; Breast cancer; Binding analysis; Cell binding assay; Crystal structure; Gastric cancer; Insertion mutation; Point mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides, cells in HER2-enriched or luminal subtype were more sensitive to CYH33 than basal-like breast cancer. Sensitivity to CYH33 has been further revealed to be associated with induction of G1 phase arrest and simultaneous inhibition of Akt and ERK. Sensitivity of patient-derived xenograft to CYH33 was also positively correlated with decrease in phosphorylated ERK.

Both caused inhibition of AKT, relief of feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, and growth arrest. However, only the PI3K inhibitors caused rapid induction of cell death. In seeking a mechanism for this phenomenon, we found that PI3K inhibition, but not AKT inhibition, causes rapid inhibition of wild-type RAS and of RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Inhibition of RAS–ERK signaling is transient, rebounding a few hours after drug addition, and is required for rapid induction of apoptosis. Combined MEK and AKT inhibition also promotes cell death, and in murine models of HER2+ cancer, either pulsatile PI3K inhibition or combined MEK and AKT inhibition causes tumor regression. We conclude that PI3K is upstream of RAS and AKT and that pulsatile inhibition of both pathways is sufficient for effective antitumor activity. Significance: We show that the RAS–ERK pathway is a key downstream effector pathway of oncogenic PI3K. Coordinate downregulation of AKT and ERK is necessary for induction of apoptosis and antitumor activity and can be accomplished with pulsatile dosing, which will likely decrease toxicity and allow administration of therapeutic doses.

We sought to discover predictive biomarker for the efficacy of BYL719 by dissecting the proliferative signaling pathway mediated by PI3K in breast cancer. BYL719 concurrently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in PIK3CA-mutated human breast cancer cells. PI3K-regulated ERK phosphorylation was independent of canonical PDK1/AKT/mTOR pathway, while it was associated with RAF/MEK. Hyper-activation of EGFR or RAS abrogated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by BYL719. Furthermore, hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, c-MET, FGFR and HER3 but not IGF-1R restored ERK phosphorylation and cell viability suppressed by BYL719, suggesting the discriminative functions of RTKs in cell signaling and proliferation. By profiling 22 breast cancer cell lines, we found that BYL719 was more potent in cell lines where phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK was attenuated than those where only AKT phosphorylation was inhibited. The potency of BYL719 was further found to be significantly correlated with the expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer cells. Specifically, overexpression of EGFR, c-MET and/or FGFR1 forecasted resistance, while overexpression of IGF-1R and/or HER2 predicted sensitivity to BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Similar correlation between BYL719 efficacy and expression profile of RTKs was found in patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer. Thus, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 contributes to its antitumor efficacy and is determined by the converged signaling from RTKs. The expression profile of RTKs in breast cancer tissue could be potentially developed as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PI3Kα inhibitors.","2017","2021-09-11 23:22:25","2021-09-11 23:22:30","2021-09-11 23:22:25","974-986","","4","7","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HDGXBRNF/Xu et al. - 2017 - Integration of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Determine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intriguingly, this function of KDM4B on UPR requires its demethylase activity but is independent of its canonical role in histone modification, and acts through its cytoplasmic interaction with eIF2α, a crucial component of UPR signaling, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of this component. Targeting KDM4B in combination with PI3K inhibition induces further activation of UPR, leading to robust synergy in apoptosis.

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:26","2021-09-11 23:25:27","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/274AZF92/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","2021-09-11 23:27:36","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PSGJGQVZ/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present preclinical data demonstrating parsaclisib as a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ with over 1000-fold selectivity against other class 1 PI3K isozymes. Parsaclisib directly blocks PI3K signaling–mediated cell proliferation in B-cell lines in vitro and in vivo and indirectly controls tumor growth by lessening immunosuppression through regulatory T-cell inhibition in a syngeneic lymphoma model. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines overexpressing MYC were insensitive to proliferation blockade via PI3Kδ signaling inhibition by parsaclisib, but their proliferative activities were reduced by suppression of MYC gene transcription. Molecular structure analysis of the first- and next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors combined with clinical observation suggests that hepatotoxicity seen with the first-generation inhibitors could result from a structure-related off-target effect. Parsaclisib is currently being evaluated in multiple phase 2 clinical trials as a therapy against various hematologic malignancies of B-cell origin (NCT03126019, NCT02998476, NCT03235544, NCT03144674, and NCT02018861). SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The preclinical properties described here provide the mechanism of action and support clinical investigations of parsaclisib as a therapy for B-cell malignancies. MYC overexpression was identified as a resistance mechanism to parsaclisib in DLBCL cells, which may be useful in guiding further translational studies for the selection of patients with DLBCL who might benefit from PI3Kδ inhibitor treatment in future trials. Hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3Kδ inhibitors may be an off-target effect of that class of compounds.","2020-07-01","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","2021-09-11 23:28:53","211-222","","1","374","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 by The Author(s).

PI3Kδ has been validated as a promising target for cancer therapy, and specific PI3Kδ inhibitors were approved for clinical practice. However, the substantial toxicity and relatively low efficacy as a monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) limit their clinical use. In this study, we described a novel PI3Kδ inhibitor SAF-248, which exhibited high selectivity for PI3Kδ (IC50 = 30.6 nM) over other PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels, while sparing most of the other human protein kinases in the kinome profiling. SAF-248 exhibited superior antiproliferative activity against 27 human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines compared with the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib. In particular, SAF-248 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of seven DLBCL cell lines (with GI50 values < 1 μM in 5 DLBCL cell lines). We demonstrated that SAF-248 concentration-dependently blocked PI3K signaling followed by inducing G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL KARPAS-422, Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Its activity against the DLBCL cells was negatively correlated to the protein level of PI3Kα. Oral administration of SAF-248 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from Pfeiffer and TMD8 cells. Activation of mTORC1, MYC and JAK/STAT signaling was observed upon prolonged treatment and co-targeting these pathways would potentiate the activity of SAF-248. Taken together, SAF-248 is a promising selective PI3Kδ inhibitor for the treatment of DLBCL and rational drug combination would further improve its efficacy.","2021-03-29","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","2021-09-11 23:29:08","1-11","","","","","Acta Pharmacol Sin","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to CPS and SIMM","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4 inhibitors for PEL.","2016-04-01","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","2021-09-11 23:30:28","1797-1810","","14","35","","Oncogene","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Europe PMC","","PMID: 26119939 PMCID: PMC4486341","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YFSGJWJW/Gopalakrishnan et al. - 2016 - Immunomodulatory drugs target IKZF1-IRF4-MYC axis .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes. Finally, targeting AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to anti-EGF receptor targeted therapy.

However, little is known about the effect of sauchinone on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of sauchinone and the underlying mechanism using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the mast cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) model. Sauchinone markedly suppressed FcεRI-mediated activation of positive signaling mediators, including Syk, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), phospholipase C (PLC)γ, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Akt, IκB kinase (IKK), and intracellular Ca2+, and increased the activation of negative signaling mediators, including liver kinase B (LKB)1/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. Interestingly, sauchinone increased the interaction between SHP-1 and Syk. Consequently, sauchinone significantly suppressed FcεRI-mediated BMMC degranulation and synthesis of eicosanoids and cytokines. These inhibitory effects of sauchinone were diminished in BMMCs treated with siRNAs targeting LKB1, AMPKα2, or SHP-1, and in BMMCs isolated from AMPKα2-deficient mice. In addition, administration of sauchinone markedly suppressed the IgE-mediated PCA reaction in wild-type mice, and this inhibitory effect was significantly reduced in AMPKα2−/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that sauchinone suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis through modulation of the LKB1/AMPK and SHP-1/Syk pathways. Therefore, sauchinone might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases.","2019-09-01","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","2021-09-11 23:33:59","105702","","","74","","International Immunopharmacology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; Allergy; Mast cell; Sauchinone; Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show here that suckling-weaning and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the glucagon/insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK. Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion under limited-glucose conditions, whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both insulin and glucagon induced AMPKα phosphorylation at its Ser485/491 residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic energy charge. Our results suggest that nutritional changes (i.e. glucose availability), rather than the related hormonal changes (i.e. the glucagon/insulin ratio), sensitize AMPK activation to the energetic stress induced by the dietary transition during fasting. This effect is critical for preserving the cellular energy state in the liver.","2020-05-01","2021-09-11 23:35:04","2021-09-11 23:35:04","2021-09-11 23:35:04","5836-5849","","18","295","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VEBKH77W/Huet et al. - 2020 - Glucose availability but not changes in pancreatic.pdf","","","AMP-activated kinase (AMPK); energy homeostasis; glucagon; glucose; hepatocyte; insulin; liver; metabolic regulation; metformin; nutrient sensing; nutritional transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, using rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model, we found that DHA reduced cell proliferation and viability in RMS cells, but not those in normal cells, which was associated with inhibition of mTORC1. Mechanistically, DHA did not bind to mTOR or FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12). In addition, DHA neither inhibited insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (Erk1/2), nor activated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in the cells. Rather, DHA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK, ectopic expression dominant negative or kinase-dead AMPK, or knockdown of AMPKa attenuated the inhibitory effect of DHA on mTORC1 in the cells. Additionally, DHA was able to induce dissociation of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (raptor) from mTOR and inhibit mTORC1 activity. Moreover, treatment with artesunate, a prodrug of DHA, dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and concurrently activated AMPK and suppressed mTORC1 in RMS xenografts. The results indicated that DHA inhibits mTORC1 by activating AMPK in tumor cells.

Here, we show that curcumin concentration- and time-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and their downstream substrates in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and this inhibitory effect acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or disruption of TSC1-TSC2 complex by small interfering RNA or gene knockout only partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream signaling, indicating that they are not the primary effectors of curcumin-mediated inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition of these kinases failed to rescue the inhibition by curcumin.

Endogenous Sestrins maintain insulin-dependent AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation during high-fat diet–induced obesity, and overexpressed Sestrins activate AKT in various cell types, including liver and skeletal muscle cells. Although Sestrin-mediated AKT activation improves metabolic parameters, the mechanistic details underlying such improvement remain elusive. Here, we investigated how Sestrin2, the Sestrin homolog highly expressed in liver, induces strong AKT activation. We found that two known targets of Sestrin2, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, are not required for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Rather, phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, kinases upstream of AKT, were essential for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Among these kinases, mTORC2 catalytic activity was strongly up-regulated upon Sestrin2 overexpression in an <i>in vitro</i> kinase assay, indicating that mTORC2 may represent the major link between Sestrin2 and AKT. As reported previously, Sestrin2 interacted with mTORC2; however, we found here that this interaction occurs indirectly through GATOR2, a pentameric protein complex that directly interacts with Sestrin2.

The cellular energy sensor and regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was suggested as a putative mediator of cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, the leading anthracycline drug, by our earlier work. Here, we study the interference of doxorubicin with AMPK signalling and potentially involved mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of doxorubicin on cell signalling are studied in isolated Langendorff-perfused Wistar rat hearts and in hearts from doxorubicin-treated Wistar rats. In both models, doxorubicin induces energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress. Despite energy depletion and unaffected AMPK upstream signalling, doxorubicin does not activate the AMPK pathway and even reduces basal phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In contrast, oxidative and genotoxic stress do activate pro-survival mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways, the latter via DNA-dependent protein kinase activation triggered by DNA damage. Combined inhibition of AMPK and activation of Akt and MAPK lead to activation of growth-stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the doxorubicin-challenged heart, a combined energetic, oxidative, and genotoxic stress elicits a specific, hierarchical response where AMPK is inhibited at least partially by the known negative cross-talk with Akt and MAPK pathways, largely triggered by DNA damage signalling. Although such signalling can be protective, e.g. by limiting apoptosis, it primarily induces a negative feedback that increases cellular energy deficits, and via activation of mTOR signalling, it also contributes to the pathological cardiac phenotype in chronic doxorubicin toxicity.","2012-08-01","2021-09-11 23:37:47","2021-09-11 23:37:47","","290-299","","3","95","","Cardiovasc Res","Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22461523","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/AP6WY58S/Gratia et al. - 2012 - Inhibition of AMPK signalling by doxorubicin at t.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22461523","","Phosphorylation; Animals; Enzyme Activation; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Disease Models, Animal; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; DNA Damage; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Energy Metabolism; Heart Diseases; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.","2012-09-07","2021-09-11 23:41:15","2021-09-11 23:41:15","2021-09-11 23:41:15","e44957","","9","7","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/QMJ2Z8LE/Hahm et al. - 2012 - Notch Activation Is Dispensable for D, L-Sulforaph.pdf","","","Apoptosis; Cancer treatment; Transfection; Breast cancer; Cancer cell migration; Cell migration; Prostate cancer; Small interfering RNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.","2009-09-01","2021-09-11 23:42:25","2021-09-11 23:42:25","","6941-50","","","69","","Cancer research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5NBXCPGY/Mühlenberg et al. - 2009 - Inhibitors of Deacetylases Suppress Oncogenic KIT .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26766848_Inhibitors_of_Deacetylases_Suppress_Oncogenic_KIT_Signaling_Acetylate_HSP90_and_Induce_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dramatic metabolic responses following imatinib treatment indicate a high, KIT-dependent glucose turnover which has been particularly helpful for predicting tumor response to imatinib. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibits glucose metabolism in cancer cells that depend on aerobic glycolysis for ATP production. We show that 2DG inhibits proliferation in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines at levels that can be achieved clinically. KIT-negative GIST48B have 3-14-fold higher IC50 levels than KIT-positive GIST cells indicating that oncogenic KIT may sensitize cells to 2DG. GIST sensitivity to 2DG is increased in low-glucose media (110mg/dl). 2DG leads to dose- and glucose dependent inhibition of KIT glycosylation with resultant reduction of membrane-bound KIT, inhibition of KIT-phosphorylation and inactivation of KIT-dependent signaling intermediates. In contrast to imatinib, 2DG caused ER-stress and elicited the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mannose but not pyruvate rescued GIST cells from 2DG-induced growth arrest, suggesting that loss of KIT integrity is the predominant effect of 2DG in GIST. Additive anti-tumoral effects were seen with imatinib and BH3-mimetics. Our data provide the first evidence that modulation of the glucose-metabolism by 2DG may have a disease-specific effect and may be therapeutically useful in GIST.","2015-03-17","2021-09-11 23:42:51","2021-09-11 23:42:51","","e0120531","","","10","","PloS one","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BYWNTNCH/Mühlenberg et al. - 2015 - Inhibition of KIT-Glycosylation by 2-Deoxyglucose .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273786413_Inhibition_of_KIT-Glycosylation_by_2-Deoxyglucose_Abrogates_KIT-Signaling_and_Combination_with_ABT-263_Synergistically_Induces_Apoptosis_in_Gastrointestinal_Stromal_Tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imatinib-resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and little is known about KIT functional roles in imatinib-resistant GIST. Biological consequences of biochemical inhibition of KIT, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), PLCgamma, MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK were determined by immunoblotting for protein activation, and by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in GIST cell lines from imatinib-sensitive GIST (GIST882), imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST430 and GIST48) and KIT-negative GIST (GIST62). KIT activation was 3- to 6-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48 than in GIST882, whereas total KIT expression was comparable in these three GIST lines. In addition to the higher set point for KIT activation, GIST430 and GIST48 had intrinsic imatinib resistance. After treatment with 1 muM imatinib, residual KIT activation was 6- and 2.8-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48, respectively, compared to GIST882. In all GIST lines, cell growth arrest resulted from PI3-K inhibition, and - to a lesser extent - from MEK/MAPK and mTOR inhibition. Inhibition of JAK/STAT or PLCgamma did not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, only PI3-K inhibition resulted in substantial apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant GISTs. We conclude that GIST secondary KIT mutations can be associated with KIT hyperactivation and imatinib resistance. Targeting critical downstream signaling proteins, such as PI3-K, is a promising therapeutic strategy in imatinib-resistant GISTs.","2007-12-01","2021-09-11 23:45:02","2021-09-11 23:45:02","","7560-8","","","26","","Oncogene","KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MEQURLTR/Bauer et al. - 2007 - KIT oncogenic signaling mechanisms in imatinib-res.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6290596_KIT_oncogenic_signaling_mechanisms_in_imatinib-resistant_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor_PI3-kinaseAKT_is_a_crucial_survival_pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies are effective in BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and lung cancers; however, responses are short-lived due to emergence of resistance. Reactivation of ERK signaling is central to the mechanisms of acquired resistance. Therefore, ERK inhibition provides an opportunity to overcome resistance and leads to improved efficacy. In addition, KRAS-mutant cancers remain an unmet medical need in which ERK inhibitors may provide treatment options alone or in combination with other agents.

Here, we examine whether senescent cells can lose senescence hallmarks and reenter a reversible state of cell-cycle arrest (quiescence). We constructed a molecular regulatory network of cellular senescence based on previous experimental evidence. To infer the regulatory logic of the network, we performed phosphoprotein array experiments with normal human dermal fibroblasts and used the data to optimize the regulatory relationships between molecules with an evolutionary algorithm. From ensemble analysis of network models, we identified 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) as a promising target for inhibitors to convert the senescent state to the quiescent state. We showed that inhibition of PDK1 in senescent human dermal fibroblasts eradicates senescence hallmarks and restores entry into the cell cycle by suppressing both nuclear factor κB and mTOR signaling, resulting in restored skin regeneration capacity. Our findings provide insight into a potential therapeutic strategy to treat age-related diseases associated with the accumulation of senescent cells.</p>","2020-12-08","2021-09-11 23:52:50","2021-09-11 23:53:15","2021-09-11 23:52:50","31535-31546","","49","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 33229519","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MFIXXGGR/An et al. - 2020 - Inhibition of 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TUZRN3RF/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229519","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some evidence suggests that sestrins may inhibit mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) through inhibition of RagA/B GTPases or activation of AMPK; however, whether sestrins are also involved in mTORC2 regulation and function is unclear. To investigate the functions and mechanisms of Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), we generated Sesn3 liver-specific transgenic and knockout mice. Our data show that Sesn3 liver-specific knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and Sesn3 transgenic mice were protected against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Using AMPK liver-specific knockout mice, we demonstrate that the Sesn3 insulin-sensitizing effect is largely independent of AMPK. Biochemical analysis reveals that Sesn3 interacts with and activates mTORC2 and subsequently stimulates Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings suggest that Sesn3 can activate Akt via mTORC2 to regulate hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.","2015-04-01","2021-09-11 23:53:52","2021-09-11 23:53:57","2021-09-11 23:53:52","1211-1223","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

The signalling pathways downstream of IL11 are contentious and both STAT3 and ERK have been implicated. Here we show that TGFβ1- or IL11- induced ERK activation is consistently associated with fibrogenesis whereas STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is unrelated to fibroblast activation. Surprisingly, recombinant human IL11, which has been used extensively in mouse experiments to infer STAT3 activity downstream of IL11, non-specifically increases pSTAT3 in Il11ra1 null mouse fibroblasts. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 prevents TGFβ1-induced fibrogenesis but this effect was found to reflect fibroblast dysfunction due to severe proteotoxic ER stress. In contrast, inhibition of MEK/ERK prevented fibrosis in the absence of ER stress. TGFβ1-stimulated ERK/mTOR/P70RSK-driven protein translation was IL11-dependent and selectivity for pro-fibrotic protein synthesis was ascribed to an EPRS-related mechanism. In TGFβ1-stimulated fibroblasts, the anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib caused dose-dependent ER stress, reduced pSTAT/pERK and inhibited pro-fibrotic protein translation, similarly to generic STAT3 inhibitors or ER stressors. Pirfenidone, while anti-fibrotic, had no effect on ER stress whereas anti-IL11 inhibited the ERK/mTOR axis while reducing ER stress. These studies discount a specific role for STAT3 in pro-fibrotic signaling, suggest a novel mechanism of action for nintedanib and prioritise further the IL11 pathway as a therapeutic target for fibrosis.","2021-06-10","2021-09-11 23:55:36","2021-09-11 23:55:37","2021-09-11 23:55:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2021.06.10.447846","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2PKUYV5C/Widjaja et al. - 2021 - Molecular dissection of pro-fibrotic signaling ide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, understanding how MYC protein stability is regulated may lead to effective therapies. Here, we used a previously developed, flow cytometry-based assay that screened a library of >800 protein kinase inhibitors and identified compounds that promoted either the stability or degradation of MYC in a KRAS-mutant PDAC cell line. We validated compounds that stabilized or destabilized MYC and then focused on one compound, UNC10112785, that induced the substantial loss of MYC protein in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell cultures. We determined that this compound is a potent CDK9 inhibitor with a previously uncharacterized scaffold, caused MYC loss through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, and suppresses PDAC anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. We discovered that CDK9 enhanced MYC protein stability through a previously unknown, KRAS-independent mechanism involving direct phosphorylation of MYC at Ser62 Our study thus not only identifies a potential therapeutic target for patients with KRAS-mutant PDAC but also presents the application of a screening strategy that can be more broadly adapted to identify regulators of protein stability.","2019-07-16","2021-09-12 00:05:09","2021-09-12 00:05:09","","eaav7259","","590","12","","Sci Signal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31311847 PMCID: PMC6728149","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/MTLMAHUQ/Blake et al. - 2019 - Application of a MYC degradation screen identifies.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311847","","Phosphorylation; Humans; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Protein Stability; Proteolysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Small Molecule Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of oligomeric architectures adopted by DegP are thought to facilitate its function. For example, DegP can form a “resting” hexamer when not engaged to substrates, mitigating undesired proteolysis of cellular proteins. When bound to substrate proteins or lipid membranes, DegP has been shown to populate a variety of cage- or bowl-like oligomeric states that have increased proteolytic activity. Though a number of DegP’s substrate-engaged structures have been robustly characterized, detailed mechanistic information underpinning its remarkable oligomeric plasticity and the corresponding interplay between these dynamics and biological function has remained elusive. Here, we have used a combination of hydrodynamics and NMR spectroscopy methodologies in combination with cryogenic electron microscopy to shed light on the apo-DegP self-assembly mechanism. We find that, in the absence of bound substrates, DegP populates an ensemble of oligomeric states, mediated by self-assembly of trimers, that are distinct from those observed in the presence of substrate. The oligomeric distribution is sensitive to solution ionic strength and temperature and is shifted toward larger oligomeric assemblies under physiological conditions. Substrate proteins may guide DegP toward canonical cage-like structures by binding to these preorganized oligomers, leading to changes in conformation. The properties of DegP self-assembly identified here suggest that apo-DegP can rapidly shift its oligomeric distribution in order to respond to a variety of biological insults.","2021-08-10","2021-09-14 00:30:21","2021-09-14 00:30:30","2021-09-14 00:30:21","","","32","118","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 34362850","","; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GPF4D39Z/e2109732118.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362850","","hydrodynamics; methyl-TROSY NMR; protein self-assembly; protein thermodynamics and kinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, but its regulation remains poorly defined. Here we show that depletion of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), a serine protease inhibitor, resulted in NLRP3- and ASC (apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain)-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 engagement. TLR2 or TLR4 agonist induced PAI-2 expression, which subsequently stabilized the autophagic protein Beclin 1 to promote autophagy, resulting in decreases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, NLRP3 protein level, and pro-IL-1β processing. Likewise, overexpressing Beclin 1 in PAI-2-deficient cells rescued the suppression of NLRP3 activation in response to LPS.

We have reported previously that GnRH-induced activities at these genes include various histone modifications, but we did not examine histone phosphorylation. This modification adds a negative charge to residues of the histone tails that interact with the negatively charged DNA, is associated with closed chromatin during mitosis, but is increased at certain genes for transcriptional activation. Thus, the functions of this modification are unclear. We initially hypothesized that GnRH might induce phosphorylation of Ser-10 in histone 3 (H3S10p) as part of its regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, possibly involving cross-talk with H3K9 acetylation. We found that GnRH increases the levels of both modifications around the Cga gene transcriptional start site and that JNK inhibition dramatically reduces H3S10p levels. However, this modification had only a minor effect on Cga expression and no effect on H3K9ac. GnRH also increased H3S28p and H3K27ac levels and also those of activated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 inhibition dramatically reduced H3S28p levels in untreated and GnRH-treated cells and also affected H3K27ac levels. Although not affecting basal Cga expression, MSK1/2 inhibition repressed GnRH activation of Cga expression. Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that GnRH-activated MSK1 targets the first nucleosome just downstream from the TSS. Given that the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) stalls at this well positioned nucleosome, GnRH-induced H3S28p, possibly in association with H3K27ac, would facilitate the progression of RNAPII.","2017-12-15","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","2021-09-14 05:17:50","20720-20731","","50","292","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GMIUT3C4/Haj et al. - 2017 - Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 is .pdf","","","chromatin; histone modification; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); phosphorylation; pituitary gland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fbxo21 deficiency in mice cells impairs virus-induced Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1, attenuates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathway, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, resulting in reduced antiviral innate response and enhanced virus replication. Therefore Fbxo21 is required for ASK1 activation via Lys29-linkage of ASK1 during antiviral innate response, providing mechanistic insights into non-proteolytic roles of SCF complex in innate immune response.","2016-04-11","2021-09-14 05:18:50","2021-09-14 05:18:54","2021-09-14 05:18:50","e14087","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eLife","","Publisher: eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DSM942EB/Yu et al. - 2016 - Lys29-linkage of ASK1 by Skp1−Cullin 1−Fbxo21 ubiq.pdf","","","antiviral response; ASK1; Fbxo21; innate immunity; polyubiquitination; SCF complex","Medzhitov, Ruslan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously reported that TRAF2 is phosphorylated following TNF stimulation and now identify the PKC kinases responsible for phosphorylation. Phosphorylated TRAF2 facilitates recruitment of IKKα and IKKβ to the TNF receptor. Phosphorylation also determines K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2 at lysine 31. TRAF2 K63-linked ubiquitination contributes to associations with TAB2/3 and activation of the downstream IKK and JNK kinases.

Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1–dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1–induced formation of K63-Ub chains and ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains. The early phase of TLR signaling and the TLR-dependent secretion of IL-10 (controlled by IRAKs 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6[L74H] mutant, but the late-phase production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα (controlled only by the pseudokinase IRAK2) was abolished. RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice.

Stk24 deficiency or knockdown markedly inhibited IL-17-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB and impaired IL-17-induced chemokines and cytokines expression. Stk24 overexpression greatly enhanced IL-17-induced NF-κB activation and expression of chemokines and cytokines in a kinase activity-independent manner. The IL-17-induced inflammatory response was significantly reduced in Stk24-deficient mice. In addition, the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was markedly reduced in mice with a deficiency of Stk24 in non-hematopoietic cells. We further demonstrated that Stk24 directly interacts with TAK1 and IKKβ and promotes the formation of TAK1/IKK complexes, leading to enhanced IKKβ/NF-κB activation and downstream cytokines and chemokines induction.

However, pharmacologically activated p53 can induce diverse responses ranging from cell death to growth arrest and DNA repair, which limits the efficient application of p53-reactivating drugs in clinic. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms defining the biological outcome upon p53 activation remains a grand challenge in the p53 field. Here, we report that concurrent pharmacological activation of p53 and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), result in the synthetic lethality in cancer cells. ROS promote the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and DNA damage response, which establishes a positive feedback loop with p53. This converts the p53-induced growth arrest/senescence to apoptosis. We identified several survival oncogenes inhibited by p53 in JNK-dependent manner, including Mcl1, PI3K, eIF4E, as well as p53 inhibitors Wip1 and MdmX. Further, we show that Wip1 is one of the crucial executors downstream of JNK whose ablation confers the enhanced and sustained p53 transcriptional response contributing to cell death. Our study provides novel insights for manipulating p53 response in a controlled way. Further, our results may enable new pharmacological strategy to exploit abnormally high ROS level, often linked with higher aggressiveness in cancer, to selectively kill cancer cells upon pharmacological reactivation of p53.","2014-04","2021-09-14 05:26:06","2021-09-14 05:26:09","2021-09-14 05:26:06","612-623","","4","21","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2014 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 4 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Cancer therapy;Pharmacology Subject_term_id: apoptosis;cancer-therapy;pharmacology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/YSRSI3RX/Shi et al. - 2014 - ROS-dependent activation of JNK converts p53 into .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, MYC, a potent oncogene, is an antinecroptotic factor that directly suppresses the formation of the RIPK1–RIPK3 complex. Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that the MYC pathway is the most prominently down-regulated signaling pathway during necroptosis. Depletion or deletion of MYC promotes the RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction, thereby stabilizing the RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and facilitating necroptosis. Interestingly, MYC binds to RIPK3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in vitro. Furthermore, MYC-nick, a truncated form that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, prevented TNF-induced necroptosis. Finally, down-regulation of MYC enhances necroptosis in leukemia cells and suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model upon treatment with birinapant and emricasan. MYC-mediated suppression of necroptosis is a mechanism of necroptosis resistance in cancer, and approaches targeting MYC to induce necroptosis represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer.","2020-08-18","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","2021-09-14 05:28:19","19982-19993","","33","117","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/43BUNHPP/Seong et al. - 2020 - Identification of MYC as an antinecroptotic protei.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation is still unclear. Here we report that the expression of cytokines is robustly upregulated in a cell-autonomous manner during necroptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). We demonstrate that TNFα-induced necroptosis leads to two waves of cytokine production. The first wave, more transient and weaker than the second, is in response to TNFα alone; whereas the second wave depends upon the necroptotic signaling. We show that necroptosis promotes the transcription of TNFα-target genes in a cell-intrinsic manner. The activation of both NF-κB and p38 by the necroptotic machinery, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, is involved in mediating the robust induction of cytokine expression in the second wave. In contrast, necroptosis induced by direct oligomerization of MLKL promotes cytokine production at much lower levels than that of necroptosis induced with TNFα. Thus, we conclude that TNFα-induced necroptosis signaling events mediated by RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation, in addition to the MLKL oligomerization, promotes the expression of cytokines involving multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms including NF-κB pathway and p38. These findings reveal that the necroptotic cell death machinery mounts an immune response by promoting cell-autonomous production of cytokines. Our study provides insights into the mechanism by which necroptosis promotes inflammation in human diseases.","2018-04-27","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","2021-09-14 05:29:17","1-16","","5","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 5 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2YPPXFNL/Zhu et al. - 2018 - Necroptosis promotes cell-autonomous activation of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Macrophages are key innate immune cells that upon encountering pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing cytokines, including IFN-β. In this study, we identify a novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing IFN-β production in macrophages. Using genetic and pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1 directs IFN-β synthesis induced by LPS in mice. Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase–dependent IFN-β production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in bone marrow–derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases. Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1 and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF–dependent IFN-β production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4. Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase–dependent synthesis of IFN-β is markedly induced by avirulent strains of Gram-negative bacteria, Yersinia and Klebsiella, and less so by their wild-type counterparts. Overall, these observations identify unexpected roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases in the production of IFN-β during the host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and suggest that the axis in which these kinases operate may represent a target for bacterial virulence factors.","2017-06-01","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","2021-09-14 05:29:38","4435-4447","","11","198","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","","","","www.jimmunol.org","","Publisher: American Association of Immunologists Section: INNATE IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION PMID: 28461567","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FJB9MMXU/Saleh et al. - 2017 - Kinase Activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 Can Direct IF.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental Design: MK-2206 effects on cell signaling were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Its antitumor efficacy was assessed in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing PIK3CA and PTEN status. Its in vivo efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel. Results: MK-2206 inhibited Akt signaling and cell-cycle progression, and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. Cell lines with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations were significantly more sensitive to MK-2206; however, several lines with PTEN/PIK3CA mutations were MK-2206 resistant. siRNA knockdown of PTEN in breast cancer cells increased Akt phosphorylation concordant with increased MK-2206 sensitivity. Stable transfection of PIK3CA E545K or H1047R mutant plasmids into normal-like MCF10A breast cells enhanced MK-2206 sensitivity. Cell lines that were less sensitive to MK-2206 had lower ratios of Akt1/Akt2 and had less growth inhibition with Akt siRNA knockdown. In PTEN-mutant ZR75-1 breast cancer xenografts, MK-2206 treatment inhibited Akt signaling, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. In vitro, MK-2206 showed a synergistic interaction with paclitaxel in MK-2206–sensitive cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater antitumor efficacy than either agent alone in vivo. Conclusions: MK-2206 has antitumor activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy. This activity may be greater in tumors with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutation, providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

Despite this wealth of information the precise signalling timeline and effectors engaged by Ras, particularly during G1, remain obscure as approaches for Ras inhibition are slow-acting and ill-suited for charting discrete Ras signalling episodes along the cell cycle. We have developed an approach based on the inducible recruitment of a Ras-GAP that enforces endogenous Ras inhibition within minutes. Applying this strategy to inhibit Ras stepwise in synchronous cell populations revealed that Ras signaling was required well into G1 for Cyclin D induction, pocket protein phosphorylation and S-phase entry, irrespective of whether cells emerged from quiescence or G2/M. Unexpectedly, Erk, and not PI3K/Akt or Ral was activated by Ras at mid-G1, albeit PI3K/Akt signalling was a necessary companion of Ras/Erk for sustaining cyclin-D levels and G1/S transition.

Although rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for the treatment of certain cancers, major success in targeting mTOR, particularly with new generation mTOR kinase inhibitors, for the effective treatment of cancers has not been achieved. Hence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the mTOR axis in cancer is still needed. It is now recognized that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on cancer cells is a critical mechanism contributing to immunosuppression and immune escape via interacting with program death-1 (PD-1) on immune cells. This study has revealed a previously undiscovered role of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the negative regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that disruption of this signaling pathway with mTOR inhibitors, raptor knockdown or p70S6K inhibitors elevated PD-L1 levels in some lung and other cancer cell lines. Elevation of PD-L1 by inhibition of mTORC1/p70S6K signaling is likely due to suppression of β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation of PD-L1, because inhibition of either mTORC1 or p70S6K facilitated β-TrCP degradation accompanied with enhanced PD-L1 protein stabilization. Our current findings indicate the complexity of the mTOR axis in cancer, which should be considered when targeting this axis for effective cancer treatment. Our findings also suggest a strong scientific rationale for enhancing PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy through co-targeting mTORC1/p70S6K signaling.","2019-08","2021-09-14 06:07:28","2021-09-14 06:07:31","2021-09-14 06:07:30","6270-6282","","35","38","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 35 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer therapy;Tumour immunology Subject_term_id: cancer-therapy;tumour-immunology","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/K7SGNPBL/Deng et al. - 2019 - Inhibition of mTOR complex 1p70 S6 kinase signali.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/R3ZA8SHW/s41388-019-0877-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","2021-09-14 06:12:21","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6V8TR9W8/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition. Our findings indicate that iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 via multiple pathways and iron is essential for mTORC1 activation.","2020-07","2021-09-14 06:16:29","2021-09-14 06:16:29","2021-09-14 06:16:29","5201-5213","","29","39","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 29 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Stress signalling;Target identification Subject_term_id: stress-signalling;target-identification","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CSIV6QS6/Shang et al. - 2020 - Iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 signaling involving.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report shows PRAS40 is regulated by AKT in cardiomyocytes and that AKT-driven phosphorylation relieves the inhibitory function of PRAS40. PRAS40 overexpression in vitro blocks mTORC1 in cardiomyocytes and decreases pathological growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.","2013-07-30","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","2021-09-14 06:16:56","12661-12666","","31","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-pnas-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 23842089","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XE8FZ5F6/Völkers et al. - 2013 - Pathological hypertrophy amelioration by PRAS40-me.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/P2E7ZRTE/tab-figures-data.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo.

As such, treatment for patients with advanced MEC is tipically radical surgery and radiotherapy. Facial disfigurement and poor quality of life are frequent treatment challenges, and many patients succumb to loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis. We know that cancer stem-like cells (CSC) drive MEC tumorigenesis. The current study tests the hypothesis that MEC CSC are sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of mTOR. Here, we report a correlation between the long-term clinical outcomes of 17 MEC patients and the intratumoral expression of p-mTOR (p = 0.00294) and p-S6K1 (p = 0.00357). In vitro, we observed that MEC CSC exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (i.e., mTOR, AKT, and S6K1), unveiling a potential strategy for targeted ablation of these cells. Using a panel of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, i.e., rapamycin and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors), buparlisib and LY294002 (AKT inhibitors), and PF4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor), we observed consistently dose-dependent decrease in the fraction of CSC, as well as inhibition of secondary sphere formation and self-renewal in three human MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B). Notably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells. In contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts. Transplantation of MEC cells genetically silenced for mTOR into immunodeficient mice corroborated the results obtained with temsirolimus. Collectively, these data demonstrated that mTOR signaling is required for CSC survival, and unveiled the therapeutic potential of targeting the mTOR pathway for elimination of highly tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","2021-01-21","2021-09-14 06:21:27","2021-09-14 06:21:27","2021-09-14 06:21:27","1-16","","1","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer stem cells;Head and neck cancer;Oral cancer Subject_term_id: cancer-stem-cells;head-and-neck-cancer;oral-cancer","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TY36U25C/Andrade et al. - 2021 - Survival of salivary gland cancer stem cells requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that this metabolic vulnerability is driven by mTORC1, which promotes resistance to chemotherapy and targeted cancer drugs, but simultaneously suppresses autophagy. We show that autophagy is essential for tumor cells to cope with therapeutic perturbation of metabolism and that mTORC1-mediated suppression of autophagy is required and sufficient for generating a metabolic vulnerability leading to energy crisis and apoptosis.

As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments.","2016-08","2021-09-14 06:21:58","2021-09-14 06:22:03","2021-09-14 06:21:58","4518-4528","","34","35","","","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 34 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Apoptosis;Autophagy;Bladder cancer;Cancer therapeutic resistance;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: apoptosis;autophagy;bladder-cancer;cancer-therapeutic-resistance;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/X36V87I3/King et al. - 2016 - Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism underlies syn.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/T8X5PHIU/onc2015511.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We manipulate the rate of Akt stimulation by employing knock-in mice expressing a mutant form of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) with reduced, but not abolished, ability to activate Akt. We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 α-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNFα-induced neurotoxicity. Opposite to the Alzheimer Disease transgenic mice, the PDK1 knock-in mice exhibited an age-dependent attenuation of the unfolding protein response, which protected the mutant neurons against endoplasmic reticulum stressors.

We showed that SP (5−20 mM) dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines JIMT-1 (ER-negative and HER2-expressing) and MCF7 (ER-positive type), and this effect was not affected by PTX, thus not mediated by the GPR41 or GPR43 SCFA receptors. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that SP treatment increased autophagic and antioxidant activity in JIMT-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells, which might be a compensatory mechanism to overcome SP-induced apoptosis, but were not sufficient to overcome SP-mediated suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. We revealed that the anticancer effect of SP was mediated by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 signaling which led to cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and increasing levels of ROS and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK which induced apoptosis. In nude mice bearing JIMT-1 and MCF7 cells xenograft, administration of SP (20 mg/mL in drinking water) significantly suppressed tumor growth by regulating STAT3 and p38 in tumor tissues.

This defect rendered accumulation of DNA damage in p53 mutant cells upon treatment with deoxyuridine analogues. Notably, inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) greatly enhanced this response, whereas normal cells responded with activation of the p53-p21 axis and cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of either p53 or p21/CDKN1A conferred the p53 mutant phenotype.

These tumors express several activated tyrosine kinase receptors, which prompted attempts to treat patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although clinical benefit was observed in phase II clinical trials with imatinib and sorafenib, and sporadically also with EGFR inhibitors, therapies evaluated to date have shown modest activity. With the goal of identifying new drugs with immediate therapeutic potential for chordoma patients, we collected clinically approved drugs and other advanced inhibitors of MET, PDGFRβ, and EGFR tyrosine kinases, and assessed their antiproliferative activity against a panel of chordoma cell lines. Chordoma cell lines were not responsive to MET and PDGFRβ inhibitors. U-CH1 and UM-Chor1 were sensitive to all EGFR inhibitors, whereas the remaining cell lines were generally insensitive to these drugs. Afatinib was the only EGFR inhibitor with activity across the chordoma panel. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the responses observed and found that the antiproliferative IC50s correlate with the unique ability of afatinib to promote degradation of EGFR and brachyury, an embryonic transcription factor considered a key driver of chordoma. Afatinib displayed potent antitumor efficacy in U-CH1, SF8894, CF322, and CF365 chordoma tumor models in vivo. In the panel analyzed, high EGFR phosphorylation and low AXL and STK33 expression correlated with higher sensitivity to afatinib and deserve further investigation as potential biomarkers of response.

To identify the mechanism by which Src overexpression sustains this resistance, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines either sensitive or resistant to lapatinib. Methods: To determine the role of Src in lapatinib resistance, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition/silencing in vitro on survival, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. In vivo experiments were performed in JIMT-1 lapatinib-resistant cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice. We used artificial metastasis assays to evaluate the effect of Src inhibition on the invasiveness of lapatinib-resistant cells. Src-dependent signal transduction was investigated with Western blot and ELISA analyses. Results: Src activation was higher in lapatinib-resistant than in lapatinib-sensitive cells. The selective small-molecule Src inhibitor saracatinib combined with lapatinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. Saracatinib combined with lapatinib significantly prolonged survival of JIMT-1-xenografted mice compared with saracatinib alone, and impaired the formation of lung metastases. Unexpectedly, in lapatinib-resistant cells, Src preferentially interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rather than with HER2. Moreover, EGFR targeting and lapatinib synergistically inhibited survival, migration, and invasion of resistant cells, thereby counteracting Src-mediated resistance. These findings demonstrate that Src activation in lapatinib-resistant cells depends on EGFRdependent rather than on HER2-dependent signaling. Conclusions: Complete pharmacologic EGFR/HER2 inhibition is required to reverse Src-dependent resistance to lapatinib in breast cancer.","2014-06","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","2021-09-14 06:26:32","R45","","3","16","","Breast Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D7D5JJ2J/Formisano et al. - 2014 - Epidermal growth factor-receptor activation modula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long-term event-free survival of children with high-risk neuroblastoma is still poor despite the improvements with current multimodality treatment protocols. Activated JAK/STAT3 pathway plays an important role in many human cancers, suggesting that targeting STAT3 is a promising strategy for treating high-risk neuroblastoma. Experimental Design: To evaluate the biologic consequences of specific targeting of STAT3 in neuroblastoma, we assessed the effect of tetracycline (Tet)-inducible STAT3 shRNA and the generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotide AZD9150 which targets STAT3 in three representative neuroblastoma cell line models (AS, NGP, and IMR32). Results: Our data indicated that Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 inhibited endogenous STAT3 and STAT3 target genes. Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA and AZD9150 decreased cell growth and tumorigenicity. In vivo, STAT3 inhibition by Tet-inducible STAT3 shRNA or AZD9150 alone had little effect on growth of established tumors. However, when treated xenograft tumor cells were reimplanted into mice, there was a significant decrease in secondary tumors in the mice receiving AZD9150-treated tumor cells compared with the mice receiving ntASO-treated tumor cells. This indicates that inhibition of STAT3 decreases the tumor-initiating potential of neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 significantly increased neuroblastoma cell sensitivity to cisplatin and decreased tumor growth and increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Conclusions: Our study supports the development of strategies targeting STAT3 inhibition in combination with conventional chemotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-14 06:31:33","2021-09-14 06:31:46","2021-09-14 06:31:33","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LQSC4S7/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/CCIY9SF9/282.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We seek to evaluate the efficacy and synergistic mechanisms of combinations with a novel SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, to inform their clinical development. Experimental Design: The combinations of TNO155 with EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi), BRAFi, KRASG12Ci, CDK4/6i, and anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody were tested in appropriate cancer models in vitro and in vivo, and their effects on downstream signaling were examined. Results: In EGFR-mutant lung cancer models, combination benefit of TNO155 and the EGFRi nazartinib was observed, coincident with sustained ERK inhibition. In BRAFV600E colorectal cancer models, TNO155 synergized with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors by blocking ERK feedback activation by different RTKs. In KRASG12C cancer cells, TNO155 effectively blocked the feedback activation of wild-type KRAS or other RAS isoforms induced by KRASG12Ci and greatly enhanced efficacy. In addition, TNO155 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib showed combination benefit in a large panel of lung and colorectal cancer patient–derived xenografts, including those with KRAS mutations. Finally, TNO155 effectively inhibited RAS activation by colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is critical for the maturation of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, and showed combination activity with anti–PD-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings suggest TNO155 is an effective agent for blocking both tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive RTK signaling in RTK- and MAPK-driven cancers and their tumor microenvironment.

Taking these data together, our study reveals that neddylation modification could regulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation and that a low dose of MLN4924 might have a therapeutic value for stem cell therapy and tissue regeneration.","2016-05-24","2021-09-14 06:32:47","2021-09-14 06:32:47","2021-09-14 06:32:47","E2935-E2944","","21","113","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","©  .

To treat lung cancer, various anticancer drugs were developed and tested, but they failed because of drug resistance. In the present study, we tested herbal medicines, such as TK and CuD, as anticancer drugs to decrease side effects and resistance. Methods Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. Analysis of cell cycle arrest was performed by flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis by cucurbitacin D was measured by an annexin V-FITC/PI assay. We performed RTK kit analysis. Levels of p-ErbB3, p-STAT3, p-NF-κB, and caspases were measured by western blot analysis. Nuclear staining of ErbB3 was measured by immunocytochemistry. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and NF-κB was detected by STAT3 and NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assays. Results We found a synergistic effect of TK with CDDP and PXD in primary culture of human NSCLC tumor cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced sub-G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD induced apoptosis, regulated apoptotic molecules, caused morphological changes and inhibited colony formation in H1299 cells. We found that TK suppresses p-ErbB3 expression and signaling. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-AKT, p-Erk, and p-JNK signaling and suppressed Stat3 and NF-κB transcriptional activity in H1299 cells. More importantly, the combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited p-ErbB3 and downstream molecules in H1299 cells. The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibited ErbB2/ErbB3 dimerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that the synergistic effect of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling. Conclusion The combination of CDDP/PXD and TK or CuD decreases cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by inhibiting ErbB3 signaling in H1299 lung cancer cells. TK or CuD could be useful as a compound to treat lung cancer. Additionally, targeting ErbB3 may also be useful for treating lung cancer.","2020-01-01","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","2021-09-14 06:33:14","153109","","","66","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/2W66ZDYR/Ku et al. - 2020 - Synergistic anticancer effect of combined use of T.pdf","","","Lung cancer; Cisplatin; Cucurbitacin D; ErbB3; Pemetrexed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of MLN4924 in induction of autophagy and its biological significance are totally unknown. Here we showed that MLN4924 effectively induces autophagy in both time- and dose-dependent manners in multiple human cancer lines, indicating a general phenomenon.

The siRNA knockdown and gene KO studies showed that DEPTOR and the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis are responsible for MLN4924-induced autophagy via inhibiting mTORC1.

There is no effective therapy for patients with metastatic UM. Improved treatments of hepatic metastatic patients with UM were urgently needed. Inspired by readily detectable key components in the neddylation pathway in UM cells, we aimed at exploring whether neddylation pathway was a therapeutic target for liver metastatic UM. Experimental Design: Expression of key proteins in the neddylation pathway in UM was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemical staining. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) properties were examined upon treatment with MLN4924, a potent and selective NAE inhibitor. Antitumor activity and frequency of CSCs were determined by using a NOD-SCID mouse xenograft model. Liver metastasis was evaluated by use of a NOD-scid-IL2Rg−/− mouse model. Results: NAE1 expression was readily detectable in UM. Inhibition of the neddylation pathway by MLN4924 repressed the CSCs properties in UM (capacities of tumorsphere formation and serially replating, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive cells, and frequency of CSC) through Slug protein degradation. MLN4924 treatment disturbed the paracrine secretion of NF-κB-mediated VEGF-C and its dependent angiogenesis. The inhibitory effect of neddylation blockade on proliferation, which was confirmed by xenografted UM tumor in NOD-SCID mice, was involved in activation of ATM-Chk1-Cdc25C DNA damage response, and G2–M phase arrest. Neddylation inhibition profoundly inhibited hepatic metastasis in UM.

EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis was required for fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a critical component of EGFR stability. Nonsustained ATP production enhanced reactive oxygen species accumulation and subsequent JNK-mediated activation of autophagy, which in turn induced EGFR degradation. Our data show that EGFR-mutant NSCLCs require EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis to maintain EGFR stability. This pathway may serve as an attractive therapeutic target for EGFR-mutant NSCLCs.

Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with various types of cancer including glioma. Here, we show that high level expression of NDRG1 in tumors significantly correlated with better prognosis of patients with GBM. Loss of NDRG1 in GBM cells upregulated GSK3β levels and promoted cell proliferation, which was reversed by selective inhibitors of GSK3β. In contrast, NDRG1 overexpression suppressed growth of GBM cells by decreasing GSK3β levels via proteasomal degradation and by suppressing AKT and S6 cell growth signaling, as well as cell-cycle signaling pathways. Conversely, GSK3β phosphorylated serine and threonine sites in the C-terminal domain of NDRG1 and limited the protein stability of NDRG1. Furthermore, treatment with differentiation inducing factor-1, a small molecule derived from Dictyostelium discoideum, enhanced NDRG1 expression, decreased GSK3β expression, and exerted marked NDRG1-dependent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which NDRG1 inhibits GBM proliferation and progression. Our study thus identifies the NDRG1/GSK3β signaling pathway as a key growth regulatory program in GBM, and suggests enhancing NDRG1 expression in GBM as a potent strategy toward the development of anti-GBM therapeutics. Significance: This study identifies NDRG1 as a potent and endogenous suppressor of glioblastoma cell growth, suggesting the clinical benefits of NDRG1-targeted therapeutics against glioblastoma.","2020-01-15","2021-09-14 06:38:02","2021-09-14 06:38:04","2021-09-14 06:38:02","234-248","","2","80","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","cancerres-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Molecular Cell Biology PMID: 31723002","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/FLNIRAAJ/Ito et al. - 2020 - Bidirectional Regulation between NDRG1 and GSK3β C.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BDRIKCEG/234.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31723002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular basis for the XAF1-mediated growth inhibition remains largely undefined. Here, we report that XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of IRF-1 to suppress tumorigenesis. Under various stressful conditions, XAF1 transcription is activated by IRF-1, and elevated XAF1 stabilizes and activates IRF-1. Mechanistically, XAF1 binds to the multifunctional domain 2 of IRF-1 via the zinc finger domain 6, thereby hindering C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interaction with and ubiquitination of IRF-1. Activation of the IRF-1−XAF1 loop greatly increases stress-induced apoptosis and decreases the invasive capability of tumor cells. Oncogenic Ras and growth factors interfere with the IRF-1−XAF1 interplay via Erk-mediated repression of XAF1 transcription. Furthermore, XAF1 enhances IRF-1-mediated transcription of proapoptotic genes via the XAF1-IRF-1 complex formation on these target promoters. Meanwhile, XAF1 inhibits NF-κB-mediated tumor cell malignancy by reinforcing IRF-1 binding to a subset of coregulated promoters. Expression levels of IRF-1 and XAF1 correlate tightly in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and XAF1-induced tumor regression is markedly attenuated in IRF-1-depleted tumors. Collectively, this study identifies a novel mechanism of XAF1-mediated tumor suppression, uncovering XAF1 as a feedback coactivator of IRF-1 under stressful conditions.","2018-07-24","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","2021-09-14 06:39:15","1-16","","8","9","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 8 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5LB5TWTM/Jeong et al. - 2018 - XAF1 forms a positive feedback loop with IRF-1 to .pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IV83MPKV/s41419-018-0867-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the state of activation of AKT in 80 human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines under serum starvation conditions. We identified 13 lines, which showed persistent AKT activation in the absence of serum. In 12 of 13 lines, AKT activation could be attributed to loss of PTEN, activating mutation in EGF receptor (EGFR) or PIK3CA, or amplification of ERBB2. HCC2429 was the only cell line that had no alterations in those genes, but had high phospho-AKT(Ser473) levels under serum starvation conditions. However, the activation of AKT in HCC2429 was PI3K- and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent based upon use of specific inhibitors. Kinome tyrosine phosphorylation profiling showed that both Notch and SRC were highly activated in this cell line. Despite the activation of Notch, AKT activation and cell survival were not affected by Notch inhibitors DAPT or compound E. In contrast, SRC inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib both significantly decreased pAKT(Ser473) levels and reduced cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibition synergistically blocked activation of AKT and induced apoptosis. Overexpression of SRC has been identified previously in human lung cancers, and these results suggest that a combination of SRC and mTOR inhibitors may have unique therapeutic benefit for a subset of lung cancers with these molecular features. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 11(3); 282–93. ©2012 AACR</i>.</p>","2013-03-01","2021-09-14 06:42:27","2021-09-14 06:42:29","2021-09-14 06:42:27","282-293","","3","11","","Mol Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","mcr-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors PMID: 23319332","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/6EU67MUE/Guo et al. - 2013 - Molecular Dissection of AKT Activation in Lung Can.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we found that a subgroup of multiple myeloma cell lines (e.g., RPMI-8226, MM.1S, KMS-12BM) and about half of the primary myeloma samples tested are sensitized to TNF-induced cell death by MLN4924. This correlated with MLN4924-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced activation of the classical NFκB pathway and reduced the efficacy of TNF-induced TNFR1 signaling complex formation. Interestingly, binding studies revealed a straightforward correlation between cell surface TNFR1 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines and their sensitivity for MLN4924/TNF-induced cell death. The cell surface expression levels of TNFR1 in the investigated MM cell lines largely correlated with TNFR1 mRNA expression. This suggests that the variable levels of cell surface expression of TNFR1 in myeloma cell lines are decisive for TNF/MLN4924 sensitivity. Indeed, introduction of TNFR1 into TNFR1-negative TNF/MLN4924-resistant KMS-11BM cells, was sufficient to sensitize this cell line for TNF/MLN4924-induced cell death.

However, continued requirement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/b-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and speciﬁc small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/b-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting b-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/b-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation–driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufﬁcient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that b-catenin–dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efﬁcacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.

WA was found to inhibit proliferation by inducing a dose-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and promoting cell death through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This was accompanied by an inhibitory shift in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway which included diminished expression and/or phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and p85 S6K with increased activation of AMPKα and the tumor suppressor tuberin/TSC2. Alterations in proteins of the MAPK pathway and cell surface receptors like EGFR, Her2/ErbB2, and c-Met were also observed. WA induced an N-acetyl-L-cysteinerepressible enhancement in cellular oxidative potential/stress with subsequent induction of a heat shock stress response primarily through HSP70, HSP32, and HSP27 upregulation and HSF1 downregulation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the responses to RITA remain enigmatic. Several groups reported the induction of a p53-dependent DNA damage response. Furthermore, the existence of a p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint has been suggested, involving the checkpoint kinase Chk1. We have recently shown synergistic induction of apoptosis by RITA in combination with Nutlin-3, and we observed concomitant Chk2 phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated whether Chk2 contributes to the cellular responses to RITA. Strikingly, the induction of apoptosis seemed entirely Chk2 dependent. Transcriptional activity of p53 in response to RITA required the presence of Chk2. A partial rescue of apoptosis observed in Noxa knockdown cells emphasized the relevance of p53 transcriptional activity for RITA-induced apoptosis. In addition, we observed an early p53- and Chk2-dependent block of DNA replication upon RITA treatment. Replicating cells seemed more prone to entering RITA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the RITA-induced DNA damage response, which was not a secondary effect of apoptosis induction, was strongly attenuated in cells lacking p53 or Chk2. In conclusion, we identified Chk2 as an essential mediator of the cellular responses to RITA.","2012-06","2021-09-14 06:46:06","2021-09-14 06:46:08","2021-09-14 06:46:06","980-989","","6","19","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IM5NVWNK/de Lange et al. - 2012 - Chk2 mediates RITA-induced apoptosis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report that phosphorylation of Sin1 at Thr 86 and Thr 398 suppresses mTORC2 kinase activity by dissociating Sin1 from mTORC2. Importantly, Sin1 phosphorylation, triggered by S6K or Akt, in a cellular context-dependent manner, inhibits not only insulin- or IGF-1-mediated, but also PDGF- or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2, demonstrating a negative regulation of mTORC2 independent of IRS-1 and Grb10. Finally, a cancer-patient-derived Sin1-R81T mutation impairs Sin1 phosphorylation, leading to hyper-activation of mTORC2 by bypassing this negative regulation. Together, our results reveal a Sin1-phosphorylation-dependent mTORC2 regulation, providing a potential molecular mechanism by which mutations in the mTORC1–S6K–Sin1 signalling axis might cause aberrant hyper-activation of the mTORC2–Akt pathway, which facilitates tumorigenesis.","2013-11","2021-09-14 06:47:42","2021-09-14 06:47:44","2021-09-14 06:47:42","1340-1350","","11","15","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 11 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Cell signalling;Growth factor signalling;TOR signalling Subject_term_id: cancer;cell-signalling;growth-signalling;tor-signalling","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/BXDRTPGQ/Liu et al. - 2013 - Sin1 phosphorylation impairs mTORC2 complex integr.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/RYPBUWIM/ncb2860.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas arginine activates mTORC1, it is overridden by high expression of cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1). Because cancer cells often encounter low levels of nutrients, an alternative mechanism might exist to regulate CASTOR1 expression. Here we show K29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of CASTOR1 by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF167. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylates CASTOR1 at S14, significantly increasing its binding to RNF167, and hence its ubiquitination and degradation, while simultaneously decreasing its affinity to MIOS, leading to mTORC1 activation. Therefore, AKT activates mTORC1 through both TSC2- and CASTOR1-dependent pathways. Several cell types with high CASTOR1 expression are insensitive to arginine regulation. Significantly, AKT and RNF167-mediated CASTOR1 degradation activates mTORC1 independent of arginine and promotes breast cancer progression.

We manipulate the rate of Akt stimulation by employing knock-in mice expressing a mutant form of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) with reduced, but not abolished, ability to activate Akt. We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 α-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNFα-induced neurotoxicity. Opposite to the Alzheimer Disease transgenic mice, the PDK1 knock-in mice exhibited an age-dependent attenuation of the unfolding protein response, which protected the mutant neurons against endoplasmic reticulum stressors.

Through governing the ubiquitination and degradation of numerous key regulators, β-TrCP1/2 regulates various cellular physiological and pathological processes. However, whether and how these two proteins cross talk and whether they regulate cell autophagy and proliferation in different manners is completely unknown. Herein, we report that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are the physiological substrates of SCF E3 ligase and target each other for degradation that is dependent on their β-TrCP degron sequences. Furthermore, glucose deprivation activates AMPK kinase to phosphorylate β-TrCP1 and promotes the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of β-TrCP1 by β-TrCP2, but does not promote β-TrCP2 degradation by β-TrCP1. Finally, we found that β-TrCP2, not β-TrCP1, preferentially degrades DEPTOR and REDD1, the inhibitors of mTORC1, to activate mTORC1, leading to autophagy inhibition and cell growth. Thus, our study demonstrates that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 mutually target each other for degradation and that β-TrCP2 acts as a dominant paralog in the regulation of cell autophagy and growth, which might be a promising anticancer target.","2020-03","2021-09-14 06:58:33","2021-09-14 06:58:34","2021-09-14 06:58:33","1119-1133","","3","27","","Cell Death Differ","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 3 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Macroautophagy;Oncogenes;Ubiquitin ligases Subject_term_id: macroautophagy;oncogenes;ubiquitin-ligases","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D3D6FY5B/Cui et al. - 2020 - The cross talk of two family members of β-TrCP in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1. Deep sequencing of LARP1-bound mRNAs reveal that non-phosphorylated LARP1 interacts with both 5’ and 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs and inhibits their translation. Importantly, phosphorylation of LARP1 by mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1 dissociates it from 5’UTRs and relieves its inhibitory activity on RP mRNA translation. Concomitantly, phosphorylated LARP1 scaffolds mTORC1 on the 3’UTRs of translationally-competent RP mRNAs to facilitate mTORC1-dependent induction of translation initiation. Thus, in response to cellular mTOR activity, LARP1 serves as a phosphorylation-sensitive molecular switch for turning off or on RP mRNA translation and subsequent ribosome biogenesis.","2017-06-26","2021-09-14 07:28:56","2021-09-14 07:28:56","2021-09-14 07:28:56","e25237","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eLife","","Publisher: eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/U3KMZWGI/Hong et al. - 2017 - LARP1 functions as a molecular switch for mTORC1-m.pdf","","","Akt; S6K1; La-related protein 1; mTORC1; ribosome biogenesis; translation","Izaurralde, Elisa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ULK1, one of the key elements of autophagy activator complex, together with the two sensors of nutrient and energy conditions, called mTORC1 and AMPK kinases, guarantee the precise function of cell response mechanism. We claim that the feedback loops of AMPK–mTORC1–ULK1 regulatory triangle determine an accurate dynamical characteristic of autophagic process upon cellular stress. By using both molecular and theoretical biological techniques, here we reveal that a delayed negative feedback loop between active AMPK and ULK1 is essential to manage a proper cellular answer after prolonged starvation or rapamycin addition. AMPK kinase quickly gets induced followed by AMPK-P-dependent ULK1 activation, whereas active ULK1 has a rapid negative effect on AMPK-P resulting in a delayed inhibition of ULK1. The AMPK-P → ULK1 ˧ AMPK-P negative feedback loop results in a periodic repeat of their activation and inactivation and an oscillatory activation of autophagy, as well. We demonstrate that the periodic induction of self-cannibalism is necessary for the proper dynamical behaviour of the control network when mTORC1 is inhibited with respect to various stress events.

Consequently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the EGFR are among the most effective therapies for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Clinical responses to the EGFR-targeting TKIs are evaluated through 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>FDG)-PET uptake, which is decreased in patients responding favorably to therapy and is positively correlated with survival. Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for glycolysis stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib's anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling. These results support the potential clinical utility of using PFKFB3 inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs to manage NSCLC.</p>","2019-07-05","2021-09-14 07:36:13","2021-09-14 07:36:15","2021-09-14 07:36:13","10530-10543","","27","294","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 31126985","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/24BZKJ3G/Lypova et al. - 2019 - Increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-2,6-bi.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/I7HJG8EK/fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126985","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the way by which SFN activates NRF2 is well established, the molecular mechanism(s) of how SFN inhibits mTOR is not understood. Hypothesis/Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which SFN inhibits mTOR Study design and methods We used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and its CRISPR/Cas9-generated NRF2-knockout counterpart to test the requirement for NRF2 and the involvement of mTOR regulators in the SFN-mediated inhibition of mTOR. Results SFN inhibits mTOR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition occurs in the presence or in the absence of NRF2. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a positive regulator of mTOR, and treatment with SFN caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and S473, two phosphorylation sites associated with AKT activation. Interestingly however, the levels of pS552 β-catenin, an AKT phosphorylation site, were decreased, suggesting that the catalytic activity of AKT was inhibited. In addition, SFN inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the inhibition of which has been reported to promote the acetylation and decreases the kinase activity of AKT. Conclusion SFN inhibits HDAC6 and decreases the catalytic activity of AKT, and this partially explains the mechanism by which SFN inhibits mTOR.","2021-06-01","2021-09-14 07:46:58","2021-09-14 07:47:00","2021-09-14 07:46:58","153062","","","86","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZE9XUU2K/Zhang et al. - 2021 - The isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibits mTOR in a.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/HEVGFZPX/S0944711319302284.html","","","mTOR; HDAC6; NRF2; PI3K-AKT; Sulforaphane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency. Significance: We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo.

Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate several elements downstream of type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (InsR). However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR regulates IGF-IR and InsR themselves. Here we show that mTOR possesses unexpected tyrosine kinase activity and activates IGF-IR/InsR. Rapamycin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IGF-IR/InsR, which is largely dependent on rictor and mTOR. Moreover, mTORC2 promotes ligand-induced activation of IGF-IR/InsR. IGF- and insulin-induced IGF-IR/InsR phosphorylation is significantly compromised in rictor-null cells. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) directly interacts with SIN1 thereby recruiting mTORC2 to IGF-IR/InsR and promoting rapamycin- or ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR/InsR. mTOR exhibits tyrosine kinase activity towards the general tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) and IGF-IR/InsR. Both recombinant mTOR and immunoprecipitated mTORC2 phosphorylate IGF-IR and InsR on Tyr1131/1136 and Tyr1146/1151, respectively. These effects are independent of the intrinsic kinase activity of IGF-IR/InsR, as determined by assays on kinase-dead IGF-IR/InsR mutants. While both rictor and mTOR immunoprecitates from rictor+/+ MCF-10A cells exhibit tyrosine kinase activity towards IGF-IR and InsR, mTOR immunoprecipitates from rictor−/− MCF-10A cells do not induce IGF-IR and InsR phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-deficient mutation of residue Tyr1131 in IGF-IR or Tyr1146 in InsR abrogates the activation of IGF-IR/InsR by mTOR. Finally, overexpression of rictor promotes IGF-induced cell proliferation.

We have reported previously that TGF-β1 induces the selective up-regulation of mitochondrial Nox4, playing critical roles in podocyte apoptosis. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Nox4 up-regulation by mTORC1 activation on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in immortalized podocytes. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Blocking TGF-β receptor I with SB431542 completely blunted the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. Transient adenoviral overexpression of mTOR-WT and constitutively active mTORΔ augmented TGF-β1-treated Nox4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis, whereas mTOR kinase-dead suppressed the above changes. In addition, knockdown of mTOR mimicked the effect of mTOR-KD. Inhibition of mTORC1 by low-dose rapamycin or knockdown of p70S6K protected podocytes through attenuation of Nox4 expression and subsequent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by TGF-β1. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade, but not the PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway, abolished TGF-β1-induced mTOR activation. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 or mTORC1 did not reduce the TGF-β1-stimulated increase in Nox4 mRNA level but significantly inhibited total Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, double knockdown of Smad2 and 3 or only Smad4 completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2-mTORactivation.

However, the necessary signals that initiate insulin resistance during high calorie intake remain largely unknown. Our results here show that in response to a regimen of high fat or high glucose diets, Mstn levels were induced in muscle and liver of mice. High glucose- or fat- mediated induction of Mstn was controlled at the level of transcription, as highly conserved carbohydrate response and sterol-responsive (E-box) elements were present in the <i>Mstn</i> promoter and were revealed to be critical for ChREBP (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein) or SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) regulation of <i>Mstn</i> expression. Further molecular analysis suggested that the increased Mstn levels (due to high glucose or fatty acid loading) resulted in increased expression of <i>Cblb</i> in a Smad3-dependent manner. Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cblb) is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that has been shown to specifically degrade insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein. Consistent with this, our results revealed that elevated Mstn levels specifically up-regulated Cblb, resulting in enhanced ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS1. In addition, over expression or knock down of <i>Cblb</i> had a major impact on IRS1 and pAkt levels in the presence or absence of insulin. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that increased glucose levels and high fat diet, both, result in increased circulatory Mstn levels. The increased Mstn in turn is a potent inducer of insulin resistance by degrading IRS1 protein via the E3 ligase, Cblb, in a Smad3-dependent manner.</p>","2014-03-14","2021-09-14 07:52:38","2021-09-14 07:52:40","2021-09-14 07:52:38","7654-7670","","11","289","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 24451368","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/J5UTP5QR/Bonala et al. - 2014 - Myostatin Induces Insulin Resistance via Casitas B.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451368","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, while pan-PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient tumors is efficacious, upregulation of Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) promotes resistance. Importantly, we show that this resistance can be overcome through targeting AKT and we find that AKT inhibitors are superior to pan-PI3K inhibition in the context of PTEN loss. However, in the presence of wild-type PTEN and PIK3CA-activating mutations, p110α-dependent signaling is dominant and selectively inhibiting p110α is therapeutically superior to AKT inhibition.

We report that amino acids enhance the polyubiquitination of Rheb (Ub-Rheb), which shows a strong binding preference for mTORC1 and supports its activation, while the Ub-Rheb is subjected to subsequent degradation. Mechanistically, we identified ATXN3 as a Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal localization is blocked by active Rag heterodimer in response to amino acid stimulation. Consistently, cells lacking functional Rag heterodimer on the lysosome accumulate Ub-Rheb, and blockade of its degradation instigates robust lysosomal mTORC1 localization and its activation without the Ragulator-Rag system. Thus, polyubiquitination of Rheb is an important post-translational modification, which facilitates the binding of mTORC1 to Rheb on the lysosome and is another crosstalk between the amino acid and growth factor signaling for mTORC1 activation.","2020-11-05","2021-09-23 20:30:47","2021-09-23 20:30:47","2021-09-23 20:30:46","437-451.e6","","3","80","","Molecular Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DURHYY56/S1097276520306870.html","","","amino acids; ATXN3; deubiquitination; lysosome; mTORC1; Rag; Ragulator; Rheb; ubiquitin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that the acetylation of the C-terminal region (CTR) of S6K1 blocks mTORC1-dependent Thr-389 phosphorylation, an essential phosphorylation site for S6K1 activity. The acetylation of the CTR of S6K1 is inhibited by the class III histone deacetylases, SIRT1 and SIRT2. An S6K1 mutant lacking acetylation sites in its CTR shows enhanced Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity, whereas the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant exhibits decreased Thr-389 phosphorylation and kinase activity. Interestingly, relative to the acetylation-mimetic S6K1 mutant, the acetylation-defective mutant displays higher affinity toward Raptor, an essential scaffolding component of mTORC1 that recruits mTORC1 substrates.

USP9x inhibited the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TIF1γ from binding and monoubiquitinating SMAD4, hence maintaining the SMAD4 nuclear retention. FFA further facilitated TGFβ-induced ERK activation, SMAD4 phosphorylation, and nuclear retention, promoting TGFβ-dependent cancer progression. Inhibition of ERK and USP9x suppressed obesity-induced metastasis. In addition, clinical data indicated that phospho-ERK and -SMAD4 levels correlate with activated TGFβ signaling and metastasis in overweight/obese patient breast cancer specimens.

Here we assessed mLST8 loss in a panel of normal and cancer cells and observed little to no impact on assembly or activity of mTORC1. However, mLST8 loss blocked mTOR association with mTORC2 cofactors RICTOR and SIN1, thus abrogating mTORC2 activity. Similarly, a single pair of mutations on mLST8 with a corresponding mutation on mTOR interfered with mTORC2 assembly and activity without affecting mTORC1. We also discovered a direct interaction between mLST8 and the NH2-terminal domain of the mTORC2 cofactor SIN1. In PTEN-null prostate cancer xenografts, mLST8 mutations disrupting the mTOR interaction motif inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation and decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the scaffolding function of mLST8 is critical for assembly and activity of mTORC2, but not mTORC1, an observation that could enable therapeutic mTORC2-selective inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Significance: These findings show that mLST8 functions as a scaffold to maintain mTORC2 integrity and kinase activity, unveiling a new avenue for development of mTORC2-specific inhibitors.","2019-07-01","2021-09-23 20:47:43","2021-09-23 20:47:43","2021-09-23 20:47:43","3178-3184","","13","79","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","en","©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","","","","cancerres-aacrjournals-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Publisher: American Association for Cancer Research Section: Priority Reports PMID: 31085701","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/XHEPNLS8/Hwang et al. - 2019 - Disruption of the Scaffolding Function of mLST8 Se.pdf; ; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/S8SP92MW/3178.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085701","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K pathway in tumor-bearing KitV558Δ/+ mice with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor voxtalisib, the pan-PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib, and the PI3K-alpha–restricted inhibitor alpelisib each diminished tumor proliferation.

TNBC frequently harbors alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, but single agent PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have not shown marked efficacy. In this study, we investigated a strategy to improve efficacy of PI3K-α inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) in TNBC. While BYL719 is effective at inhibiting cell proliferation in T47D, a triple positive cell line, it had limited activity in TNBC. This may be partially due to persistent phosphorylation of RB, and incomplete inhibition of p-S6 in TNBC, since the inhibitory effect of BYL719 on p-RB and p-S6 was significantly reduced in TNBC compared to T47D cells. Addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 to BYL719 caused a simultaneous reduction of p-RB and p-S6, and a more complete inhibition of p-S6, leading to decreased expression of the pro-survival protein MCL-1, an induction of apoptosis, and an enhanced reduction of tumor growth in a PDX model of TNBC. These findings suggest that inhibition of p-RB and p-S6 is important for an effective response to the treatment of TNBC, and provides a strong rationale for clinical development of combination therapy with BYL719 and LEE011 for treatment of metastatic TNBC with intact RB.","2019-05-17","2021-09-23 21:01:23","2021-09-23 21:01:23","2021-09-23 21:01:23","7509","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Targeted therapies Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;targeted-therapies","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/NBZBA6PF/Yuan et al. - 2019 - Combination therapy with BYL719 and LEE011 is syne.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/PXRSIENE/s41598-019-43429-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we show that NF-κB is activated by the two most common PI3K mutations, PIK3CA E545K and H1047R. We found that markers of NF-κB are most strongly upregulated under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Gene expression analysis conducted on cells deprived of growth factors identified the repertoire of genes altered by oncogenic PI3K mutations following growth factor deprivation. This gene set most closely correlated with gene signatures from claudin-low and basal-like breast tumors, subtypes frequently exhibiting constitutive PI3K/Akt activity. An NF-κB–dependent subset of genes driven by oncogenic PI3K mutations was also identified that encoded primarily secreted proteins, suggesting a paracrine role for this gene set. Interestingly, while NF-κB activated by oncogenes such as Ras and EGF receptor leads to cell-autonomous effects, abrogating NF-κB in PI3K-transformed cells did not decrease proliferation or induce apoptosis. However, conditioned media from PI3K mutant-expressing cells led to increased STAT3 activation in recipient THP-1 monocytes or normal epithelial cells in a NF-κB and interleukin-6–dependent manner. Together, our findings describe a PI3K-driven, NF-κB–dependent transcriptional profile that may play a critical role in promoting a microenvironment amenable to tumor progression. These data also indicate that NF-κB plays diverse roles downstream from different oncogenic signaling pathways.

Experience with other successful targeted agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may reduce the durability of clinical benefit. Here, we sought to understand mechanisms underlying resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient cancers. We generated cell lines resistant to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 from parental PTEN-null breast cancer cell lines and identified a novel PIK3CB D1067Y mutation in both cell lines that was recurrent in cancer patients. Stable expression of mutant PIK3CB variants conferred resistance to PI3K inhibition that could be overcome by downstream AKT or mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that the p110β D1067Y mutant was highly activated and induced PIP3 levels at the cell membrane, subsequently promoting the localization and activation of AKT and PDK1 at the membrane and driving PI3K signaling to a level that could withstand treatment with proximal inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the PIK3CB D1067Y mutant behaved as an oncogene and transformed normal cells, an activity that was enhanced by PTEN depletion. Collectively, these novel preclinical and clinical findings implicate the acquisition of activating PIK3CB D1067 mutations as an important event underlying the resistance of cancer cells to selective PI3K inhibitors.

Surprisingly, AMPK is also activated by growth factor EGF through Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinase and is essential for EGF-mediated Akt activation and biological functions. AMPK phosphorylates Skp2 at S256 and promotes the integrity and E3 ligase activity of Skp2 SCF complex leading to K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of Akt and subsequent oncogenic processes. Importantly, AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation promotes breast cancer progression in mouse tumor models, correlates with Akt and AMPK activation in breast cancer patients, and predicts poor survival outcomes. Finally, targeting AMPK-mediated Skp2 S256 phosphorylation sensitizes cells to anti-EGF receptor targeted therapy.

Colchicine binds tubulin and depolymerizes microtubules, but it remains unclear how this mechanism blocks myeloid cell recruitment to inflamed tissues. Here we show that colchicine inhibits myeloid cell activation via an indirect mechanism involving the release of hepatokines. We find that a safe dose of colchicine depolymerizes microtubules selectively in hepatocytes but not in circulating myeloid cells. Mechanistically, colchicine triggers Nrf2 activation in hepatocytes, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory hepatokines, including growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Nrf2 and GDF15 are required for the anti-inflammatory action of colchicine in vivo. Plasma from colchicine-treated mice inhibits inflammatory signalling in myeloid cells in a GDF15-dependent manner, by positive regulation of SHP-1 (PTPN6) phosphatase, although the precise molecular identities of colchicine-induced GDF15 and its receptor require further characterization. Our work shows that the efficacy and safety of colchicine depend on its selective action on hepatocytes, and reveals a new axis of liver–myeloid cell communication.

Taken together, these findings provide a strong rationale to reassess the role of PKC isoforms in cancer, and suggest in some situations their activation can be a promising strategy for anticancer drug discovery.","2021-01-08","2021-07-12 05:31:04","2021-07-12 16:59:52","2021-07-12 05:31:04","207","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Mechanism of action;Natural products Subject_term_id: mechanism-of-action;natural-products","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/DCP8MZV9/Cullen et al. - 2021 - Activation of PKC supports the anticancer activity.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/ZTWCUAVB/s41598-020-80397-9.html","","Medium; Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the role of autophagy in metabolic dysregulation, there is a need to identify autophagy regulators as therapeutic targets. To address this need, we conducted an autophagy phenotype-based screen and identified the natural compound kaempferide (Kaem) as an autophagy enhancer. Kaem promoted autophagy through translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) without MTOR perturbation, suggesting it is safe for administration. Moreover, Kaem accelerated lipid droplet degradation in a lysosomal activity-dependent manner in vitro and ameliorated metabolic dysregulation in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. To elucidate the mechanism underlying Kaem’s biological activity, the target protein was identified via combined drug affinity responsive target stability and LC–MS/MS analyses. Kaem directly interacted with the mitochondrial elongation factor TUFM, and TUFM absence reversed Kaem-induced autophagy and lipid degradation. Kaem also induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) to sequentially promote lysosomal Ca2+ efflux, TFEB translocation and autophagy induction, suggesting a role of TUFM in mtROS regulation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Kaem is a potential therapeutic candidate/chemical tool for treating metabolic dysregulation and reveal a role for TUFM in autophagy for metabolic regulation with lipid overload.","2021-01-04","2021-07-12 05:31:30","2021-07-12 17:22:34","2021-07-12 05:31:30","1-17","","1","4","","Commun Biol","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Mechanism of action;Molecular medicine Subject_term_id: mechanism-of-action;molecular-medicine","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/JEJ384L9/Kim et al. - 2021 - Activation of mitochondrial TUFM ameliorates metab.pdf","","South Korea; 10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its clinical utility as an oral anticancer agent, however, is limited by poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal toxicity. Fosciclopirox, the phosphoryloxymethyl ester of CPX (Ciclopirox Prodrug, CPX-POM), selectively delivers the active metabolite, CPX, to the entire urinary tract following parenteral administration. We characterized the activity of CPX-POM and its major metabolites in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of high-grade urothelial cancer. CPX inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroid formation, and increased cell cycle arrest at S and G0/G1 phases. Mechanistically, CPX suppressed activation of Notch signaling. Molecular modeling and cellular thermal shift assays demonstrated CPX binding to γ-secretase complex proteins Presenilin 1 and Nicastrin, which are essential for Notch activation. To establish in vivo preclinical proof of principle, we tested fosciclopirox in the validated N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) mouse bladder cancer model. Once-daily intraperitoneal administration of CPX-POM for four weeks at doses of 235 mg/kg and 470 mg/kg significantly decreased bladder weight, a surrogate for tumor volume, and resulted in a migration to lower stage tumors in CPX-POM treated animals. This was coupled with a reduction in the proliferation index. Additionally, there was a reduction in Presenilin 1 and Hes-1 expression in the bladder tissues of CPX-POM treated animals. Following the completion of the first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT03348514), the pharmacologic activity of fosciclopirox is currently being characterized in a Phase 1 expansion cohort study of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients scheduled for cystectomy (NCT04608045) as well as a Phase 2 trial of newly diagnosed and recurrent urothelial cancer patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (NCT04525131).","2021-05-31","2021-07-12 05:33:14","2021-07-12 17:06:20","2021-07-12 05:33:14","1-20","","6","12","","Cell Death Dis","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 6 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Bladder cancer;Pharmacodynamics Subject_term_id: bladder-cancer;pharmacodynamics","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/SEHF3PYA/Weir et al. - 2021 - Fosciclopirox suppresses growth of high-grade urot.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GPSB8JXS/s41419-021-03836-z.html","","7; Kansas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AKT kinases are the canonical mTORC2 substrates; however, deleting Rictor in brown adipocytes appears to drive lipid catabolism by promoting FoxO1 deacetylation independently of AKT, and in a pathway distinct from its positive role in anabolic lipid synthesis. This facilitates FoxO1 nuclear retention, enhances lipid uptake and lipolysis, and potentiates UCP1 expression. We provide evidence that SIRT6 is the FoxO1 deacetylase suppressed by mTORC2 and show an endogenous interaction between SIRT6 and mTORC2 in both mouse and human cells.

Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S473 [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T308 (PDK1 site).

Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S473 and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis-vaccenic acid (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection. Treating HepG2 cells with Elovl5 substrates established that palmitoleic acid (16:1,n-7), but not γ-linolenic acid (18:3,n-6), induced rictor protein, Akt-S473, and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation. Inhibition of FA elongation blocked 16:1,n-7 but not 18:1,n-7 induction of rictor protein and Akt-S473 and FoxO1-S256 phosphorylation.

Interestingly, both FOXO1 and thyroid hormone (TH) have similar effects on carbohydrate and energy metabolism as well as overlapping transcriptional regulation of many target genes. Currently, little is known about the regulation of MTORC2-AKT or FOXO1 by TH. Accordingly, we performed hepatic transcriptome profiling in mice after FOXO1 knockdown in the absence or presence of TH, and we compared these results with hepatic FOXO1 and THRB1 (TRβ1) ChIP-Seq data. We identified a subset of TH-stimulated FOXO1 target genes that required co-regulation by FOXO1 and TH. TH activation of FOXO1 was directly linked to an increase in SIRT1-MTORC2 interaction and RICTOR deacetylation. This, in turn, led to decreased AKT and FOXO1 phosphorylation. Moreover, TH increased FOXO1 nuclear localization, DNA binding, and target gene transcription by reducing AKT-dependent FOXO1 phosphorylation in a THRB1-dependent manner. These events were associated with TH-mediated oxidative phosphorylation and NAD(+) production and suggested that downstream metabolic effects by TH can post-translationally activate other transcription factors. Our results showed that RICTOR/MTORC2-AKT can integrate convergent hormonal and metabolic signals to provide coordinated and sensitive regulation of hepatic FOXO1-target gene expression.","2016-01-01","2021-07-12 05:40:59","2021-07-12 16:58:28","","198-214","","1","291","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26453307 PMCID: PMC4697156","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/KR9EH4BB/Singh et al. - 2016 - Hepatic FOXO1 Target Genes Are Co-regulated by Thy.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453307","Medium; Medium-High; Singapore","Phosphorylation; Animals; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Humans; Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2; Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein; Acetylation; AKT; carbohydrate metabolism; Carrier Proteins; Cell Nucleus; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Enzyme Activation; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; gene regulation; gluconeogenesis; Hep G2 Cells; insulin signaling; Liver; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MTORC2; Multiprotein Complexes; NAD; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; RICTOR; Sirtuin 1; thyroid hormone; Thyroid Hormones; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; transcription coregulator; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2).

In this study, we used the online computational tool CellMinerTM to explore the NCI-60 drug databases for compounds with anticancer activities correlating most closely with the mRNA expression of NQO1, a marker for NRF2 pathway activity. Among the >100,000 compounds analyzed, NSC84167, termed herein as NRF2 synthetic lethality compound-01 (NSLC01), was one of the top hits (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) and selected for functional characterization. NSLC01 selectively inhibited the viabilities of four out of seven conventional pancreatic cancer cell lines and induced dramatic apoptosis in the cells with high NRF2 activation. The selective anticancer activity of NSLC01 was further validated with a panel of nine low-passage pancreatic patient-derived cell lines, and a significant reverse correlation between log(IC50) of NSLC01 and NQO1 expression was confirmed (r = −0.5563, P = 0.024). Notably, screening of a panel of nine patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) revealed six PDXs with high NQO1/NRF2 activation, and NSLC01 dramatically inhibited the viabilities and induced apoptosis in ex vivo cultures of PDX tumors. Consistent with the ex vivo results, NSLC01 inhibited the tumor growth of two NRF2-activated PDX models in vivo (P < 0.01, n = 7–8) but had no effects on the NRF2-low counterpart. To characterize the mechanism of action, we employed a metabolomic isotope tracer assay that demonstrated that NSLC01-mediated inhibition of de novo synthesis of multiple amino acids, including asparagine and methionine. Importantly, we further found that NSLC01 suppresses the eEF2K/eEF2 translation elongation cascade and protein translation of asparagine synthetase.

JAK3 has been proposed as an ideal target due to its expression being largely restricted to the immune system and its requirement for signalling by cytokine receptors using the common γ-chain. Unlike other JAKs, JAK3 possesses a cysteine in its ATP binding pocket and this has allowed the design of isoform selective covalent JAK3 inhibitors targeting this residue. We report here that mutating this cysteine to serine does not prevent JAK3 catalytic activity but does greatly increase the IC50 for covalent JAK3 inhibitors. Mice with a Cys905Ser knockin mutation in the endogenous JAK3 gene are viable and show no apparent welfare issues. Cells from these mice show normal STAT phosphorylation in response to JAK3 dependent cytokines but are resistant to the effects of covalent JAK3 inhibitors. These mice therefore provide a chemical-genetic model to study JAK3 function.","2021-05-12","2021-07-12 06:07:32","2021-07-12 17:16:43","2021-07-12 06:07:32","10093","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cytokines;Immunology;Kinases;Medicinal chemistry Subject_term_id: cytokines;immunology;kinases;medicinal-chemistry","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/VQ6DJNU2/Remenyi et al. - 2021 - Generation of a chemical genetic model for JAK3.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/EL2QYCGB/s41598-021-89356-4.html","","UK; 15; Dundee","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. Here, we show a pro-apoptotic mechanism of TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by cisplatin (CDDP). We previously reported that TFAs promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a double strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, via a non-canonical apoptotic pathway independent of tumor suppressor p53 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive kinase. However, here we found that in the case of CDDP-induced apoptosis, EA-mediated pro-apoptotic action was reversed by knockout of either p53 or ASK1, despite no increase in p53 apoptotic activity. Upon CDDP treatment, EA predominantly enhanced ROS generation, ASK1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and ultimately cell death, all of which were suppressed either by co-treatment of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor Apocynin, or by knocking out its regulatory protein, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). These results demonstrate that in response to CDDP ICLs, TFAs promote p53-dependent apoptosis through the enhancement of the Nox-RIP1-ASK1-MAPK pathway activation, providing insight into the diverse pathogenetic mechanisms of TFAs according to the types of DNA damage.","2021-05-14","2021-07-12 06:07:42","2021-07-12 16:54:41","2021-07-12 06:07:42","10350","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death;Cell signalling;Kinases;Lipids;Risk factors Subject_term_id: cell-death;cell-signalling;kinases;lipids;risk-factors","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/E79Q5N6V/Hirata et al. - 2021 - trans -Fatty acids promote p53-dependent apoptosis.pdf","","High; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55δ. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55δ are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55δ to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block.

However, α4 KD did increase the phosphorylation of p53 and ATM/ATR substrates, decreased the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and associated fragments. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was reduced, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic BAX protein did not change. Alpha4 KD reduced basal H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation, whereas adenoviral-mediated re-expression of α4 protein following α4 KD, restored basal H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139. The sensitivity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity was augmented by α4 KD. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of α4 protein in ARVM increased PP2AC expression and augmented H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin. Furthermore, pressure overload-induced heart failure was associated with reduced α4 protein expression, increased ATM/ATR protein kinase activity, increased H2AX expression and Ser139 phosphorylation.

Using a nuclear targeted Akt Substrate-based Tandem Occupancy Peptide Sponge (Akt-STOPS) that we developed for specific inhibition of Akt, a critical upstream kinase, we show that growth factor-stimulated nuclear mTORC1 activity requires nuclear Akt activity. Further mechanistic dissection suggests that nuclear Akt activity mediates growth factor-induced nuclear translocation of Raptor, a regulatory scaffolding component in mTORC1, and localization of Raptor to the nucleus results in nuclear mTORC1 activity in the absence of growth factor stimulation.

We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn−/− cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway.

One degrader induced rapid, durable and highly specific degradation of AURORA-A. In addition, we found that the degrader complex was stabilized by cooperative binding between AURORA-A and CEREBLON. Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication.

Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR–MEK but disrupts the related RAF–MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding. Our results reveal the plasticity of an interface pocket within MEK sub-complexes and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs that target the RAS pathway.","2020-12","2021-07-12 06:16:13","2021-07-12 17:20:36","2021-07-12 06:16:13","509-514","","7838","588","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7838 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Chemical biology;Drug development;Kinases;X-ray crystallography Subject_term_id: cancer;chemical-biology;drug-development;kinases;x-ray-crystallography","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/GQCB38TG/Khan et al. - 2020 - Structural basis for the action of the drug tramet.pdf","","New York; 9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates.

Both global and hepatic deletions of Sam68 significantly reduce blood glucose levels and the glucagon-induced expression of gluconeogenic genes. Protein, but not mRNA, levels of CRTC2, a crucial transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenesis, are >50% lower in Sam68-deficient hepatocytes than in wild-type hepatocytes. Sam68 interacts with CRTC2 and reduces CRTC2 ubiquitination. However, truncated mutants of Sam68 that lack the C- (Sam68ΔC) or N-terminal (Sam68ΔN) domains fails to bind CRTC2 or to stabilize CRTC2 protein, respectively, and transgenic Sam68ΔN mice recapitulate the blood-glucose and gluconeogenesis profile of Sam68-deficient mice. Hepatic Sam68 expression is also upregulated in patients with diabetes and in two diabetic mouse models, while hepatocyte-specific Sam68 deficiencies alleviate diabetic hyperglycemia and improves insulin sensitivity in mice.

Both global and endothelial cell-specific inducible knockout of BMPER cause hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance without increasing inflammation in metabolic tissues in mice. BMPER can directly activate insulin signaling, which requires its internalization and interaction with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), an integral membrane protein that transports intracellular cholesterol.

Beside chronic hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia can induce insulin resistance and dysfunction in podocytes. However, the exact mechanisms of free fatty acid (FFA)-induced podocyte insulin unresponsiveness are poorly understood. We used a type 2 diabetic mouse model (db/db) and mouse podocytes exposed to palmitic acid for 24 h followed by an insulin stimulation. Renal function and pathology were evaluated at 25 weeks of age to confirm the DN development. Our results demonstrate that saturated FFA activated the serine/threonine kinases IκB kinase (IKK)β/IκBα and mTORC1/S6K1, but not protein kinase C and c-jun N-terminal kinase, in podocytes and glomeruli of db/db mice. Activation of both kinases promoted serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1, a residue known to provoke IRS1 inhibition. Using IKK, mTORC1 and ceramide production inhibitors, we were able to blunt IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation and restore insulin stimulation of Akt.

However, its role in mammary oncogenesis remains an unsettled debate as STAT5a exhibits functional dichotomy with both pro-differentiative and pro-proliferative target genes. Phosphorylation of STAT5a serine residues, S726 and S780, may regulate STAT5a in such a way to underlie this duality. Given hematopoiesis studies showing phospho-serine STAT5a as necessary for transformation, we hypothesized that serine phosphorylation regulates STAT5a activity to contribute to its role in mammary oncogenesis, specifically in luminal breast cancer. Here, phosphorylation of S726-, S780-, and Y694-STAT5a in response to prolactin in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells was investigated with STAT5a knockdown and rescue with Y694F-, S726A-, or S780A-STAT5a, where the phospho-sites were mutated. RNA-sequencing and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that loss of each phospho-site differentially affected both prolactin-induced gene expression as well as functional pathways of breast cancer (e.g. cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation). In vitro studies of anchorage-independent growth and proliferation confirmed distinct phenotypes: whereas S780A-STAT5a decreased clonogenicity, S726A-STAT5a decreased proliferation in response to prolactin compared to wild type STAT5a.

In this study, we identified ubiquitous βArrestin 1 (βArr1) as a regulator of AR function in CRPC. Unbiased gene expression analysis of public datasets revealed increased levels of ARRB1 (the gene encoding βArr1) in CRPC when compared to normal tissue. Further, βArr1 expression correlated with enhanced AR transcriptional function in these datasets. The βArr1 partitions to both nucleus and cytosol and mechanistic studies showed that nuclear, and not cytosolic, βArr1 formed a complex with AR and AR-coregulator βCatenin and that the heterotrimeric protein complex was recruited to androgen-response elements of AR-regulated genes. Functionally, we demonstrate that depletion of βArr1 attenuates PC cell and tumor growth and metastasis, and rescued expression of nuclear, but not cytosolic, βArr1 restores the PC colony growth and invasion of Matrigel in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in mice.

The accumulation of damaged or unfolded proteins triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can act as a homeostatic response or lead to cell death. However, the factors involved in turning and adaptive response into a cell death mechanism are still not well understood. Several mechanisms leading to brain injury induced by severe hypoglycemia have been described but the contribution of the UPR has been poorly studied. Cell responses triggered during both the hypoglycemia and the glucose reinfusion periods can contribute to neuronal death. Therefore, we have investigated the activation dynamics of the PERK and the IRE1α branches of the UPR and their contribution to neuronal death in a model of glucose deprivation (GD) and glucose reintroduction (GR) in cortical neurons. Results show a rapid activation of the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4 pathway leading to protein synthesis inhibition during GD, which contributes to neuronal adaptation, however, sustained blockade of protein synthesis during GR promotes neuronal death. On the other hand, IRE1α activation occurs early during GD due to its interaction with BAK/BAX, while ASK1 is recruited to IRE1α activation complex during GR promoting the nuclear translocation of JNK and the upregulation of Chop. Most importantly, results show that IRE1α RNase activity towards its splicing target Xbp1 mRNA occurs late after GR, precluding a homeostatic role. Instead, IRE1α activity during GR drives neuronal death by positively regulating ASK1/JNK activity through the degradation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA, a negative regulator of ASK and an adaptor protein highly expressed in brain, implicated in neuroprotection. Collectively, results describe a novel regulatory mechanism of cell death in neurons, triggered by the downregulation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA induced by the IRE1α branch of the UPR.","2021-06-03","2021-07-12 06:45:23","2021-07-12 16:47:06","2021-07-12 06:45:23","1-15","","1","7","","Cell Death Discov.","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cell death in the nervous system;Molecular neuroscience;Stress signalling Subject_term_id: cell-death-in-the-nervous-system;molecular-neuroscience;stress-signalling","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/D444NY32/Gómora-García et al. - 2021 - IRE1α RIDD activity induced under ER stress drives.pdf; /Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/7PRE9AJ7/s41420-021-00518-9.html","","Medium; Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an innate immune effector, ISG12a promotes the innate immune response to viral infection. In this study, ISG12a was found to be expressed at low levels in gastrointestinal cancer, represented by hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC), and it identified as a tumor suppressor that affects clinical prognosis. ISG12a silencing accelerated the malignant transformation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. Mechanistically, ISG12a promoted β-catenin proteasomal degradation by inhibiting the degradation of ubiquitinated Axin, thereby suppressing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, β-catenin was identified as a transcription factor for PD-L1. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ISG12a suppressed expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1, rendering cancer cells sensitive to NK cell-mediated killing. This study reveals a mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of IFN. Some ISGs, as represented by ISG12a, may be useful in cancer therapy and prevention.

Hyperactivation of AKT is associated with many pathological conditions, particularly cancers. Emerging evidence indicates that arginine methylation is involved in modulating AKT signaling pathway. However, whether and how arginine methylation directly regulates AKT kinase activity remain unknown. Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), but not other PRMTs, promotes AKT activation by catalyzing symmetric dimethylation of AKT1 at arginine 391 (R391). Mechanistically, AKT1-R391 methylation cooperates with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) to relieve the pleckstrin homology (PH)-in conformation, leading to AKT1 membrane translocation and subsequent activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). As a result, deficiency in AKT1-R391 methylation significantly suppresses AKT1 kinase activity and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we show that PRMT5 inhibitor synergizes with AKT inhibitor or chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance cell death. Altogether, our study suggests that R391 methylation is an important step for AKT activation and its oncogenic function.","2021-06-08","2021-07-12 06:46:59","2021-07-12 17:18:24","2021-07-12 06:46:59","3444","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Growth factor signalling;Methylation Subject_term_id: growth-signalling;methylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/IX8SM6PI/Yin et al. - 2021 - PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation activates AKT .pdf","","27; South Carolina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanism of functional switching of TGF-β is still unknown, and it is unclear whether inhibition of TGF-β signaling results amelioration or exacerbation of cancers. Here we show that the tumor suppressor p53 cooperates with Smad proteins, which are TGF-β signal transducers, to selectively activate plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) transcription. p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 in the PAI-1 promoter to recruit histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and enhance histone H3 acetylation, resulting in transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene. Importantly, p53 is required for TGF-β-induced cytostasis and PAI-1 is involved in the cytostatic activity of TGF-β in several cell lines. Our results suggest that p53 enhances TGF-β-induced cytostatic effects by activating PAI-1 transcription, and the functional switching of TGF-β is partially caused by p53 mutation or p53 inactivation during cancer progression. It is expected that these findings will contribute to optimization of TGF-β-targeting therapies for cancer.","2016-10-19","2021-07-12 06:50:19","2021-07-12 16:56:04","2021-07-12 06:50:20","35483","","1","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Transcription;Transforming growth factor beta Subject_term_id: transcription;transforming-growth-factor-beta","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/B772D9SW/Kawarada et al. - 2016 - TGF-β induces p53Smads complex formation in the P.pdf","","Medium; Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BFRs exert adverse health effects such as neurotoxic and endocrine-disrupting effects. In this study, we found that PBP suppressed TGF-β response by accelerating the turnover rate of TGF-β receptors. PBP suppressed TGF-β-mediated cell migration, PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter gene activation, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation in various cell types. Furthermore, PBP abolished TGF-β-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression, in addition to the induction of vimentin expression and N-cadherin and fibronectin upregulation, thus blocking TGF-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition in A549 and NMuMG cells. However, this inhibition was not observed with other congeners such as tribromophenol and triiodophenol. TGF-β superfamily members play key roles in regulating various biological processes including cell proliferation and migration as well as cancer development and progression. The results of this in vitro study provide a basis for studies on the detailed relationship between PBP and modulation of TGF-β signalling. Because PBP is similar to other BFRs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), additional laboratory and mechanistic studies should be performed to examine BFRs as potential risk factors for tumorigenesis and other TGF-β-related diseases.","2017-02-23","2021-07-12 06:50:35","2021-07-12 17:27:55","2021-07-12 06:50:35","43206","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer microenvironment;Toxicology;Transforming growth factor beta Subject_term_id: cancer-microenvironment;toxicology;transforming-growth-factor-beta","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/NKJWIG7E/Chen et al. - 2017 - Pentabromophenol suppresses TGF-β signaling by acc.pdf","","18; Taiwan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in SSc in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Expression profiling and functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that STAT3 activation is mediated by the combined action of JAK, SRC, c-ABL, and JNK kinases. STAT3-deficient fibroblasts are less sensitive to the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ. Fibroblast-specific knockout of STAT3, or its pharmacological inhibition, ameliorate skin fibrosis in experimental mouse models. STAT3 thus integrates several profibrotic signals and might be a core mediator of fibrosis. Considering that several STAT3 inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials, STAT3 might be a candidate for molecular targeted therapies of SSc.","2017-10-24","2021-07-12 06:51:09","2021-07-12 16:59:17","2021-07-12 06:51:09","1130","","1","8","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Systemic sclerosis;Transforming growth factor beta Subject_term_id: systemic-sclerosis;transforming-growth-factor-beta","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/5CN2YDWJ/Chakraborty et al. - 2017 - Activation of STAT3 integrates common profibrotic .pdf","","Medium; Prague","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BMP inhibitory function of netrin-1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts was dependent on the netrin receptor neogenin, with the expression level regulated by both netrin-1 and LRIG proteins.

Here we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUD4 as a transcriptional target of the TGFβ pathway that functions through a positive feedback loop to enhance overall TGFβ activity. Interestingly we demonstrate that OTUD4 functions through both catalytically dependent and independent mechanisms to regulate TGFβ activity. Specifically, we find that OTUD4 enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting the membrane presence of TGFβ receptor I. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OTUD4 inactivates the TGFβ negative regulator SMURF2 suggesting that OTUD4 regulates multiple nodes of the TGFβ pathway to enhance TGFβ activity.","2020-09-24","2021-07-12 06:52:50","2021-07-12 17:24:38","2021-07-12 06:52:50","15725","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Cancer;Deubiquitylating enzymes;Transforming growth factor beta;Ubiquitylation Subject_term_id: cancer;deubiquitylating-enzymes;transforming-growth-factor-beta;ubiquitylation","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/9EW84ZRI/Jaynes et al. - 2020 - OTUD4 enhances TGFβ signalling through regulation .pdf","","Singapore; 21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate that rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 signaling via 4E-BP1 is a critical pathway for TGF-β1 stimulated collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts, whereas canonical PI3K/Akt signaling is not required. The importance of mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in normal and IPF fibroblasts, as well as in lung cancer-associated fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells. The inhibitory effect of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibition extended to other matrisome proteins implicated in the development of fibrosis and human disease relevance was demonstrated in live precision-cut IPF lung slices.

We previously showed that glucose intolerance in LDKO mice is resolved by hepatic inactivation of the transcription factor FoxO1 (that is, LTKO mice)—even though the liver remains insensitive to insulin. Here, we report that insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue of LDKO mice is also impaired but is restored in LTKO mice in conjunction with normal suppression of HGP by insulin. To establish the mechanism by which white adipose tissue insulin signaling and HGP was regulated by hepatic FoxO1, we identified putative hepatokines—including excess follistatin (Fst)—that were dysregulated in LDKO mice but normalized in LTKO mice. Knockdown of hepatic Fst in the LDKO mouse liver restored glucose tolerance, white adipose tissue insulin signaling and the suppression of HGP by insulin; however, the expression of Fst in the liver of healthy LTKO mice had the opposite effect. Of potential clinical significance, knockdown of Fst also improved glucose tolerance in high-fat-fed obese mice, and the level of serum Fst was reduced in parallel with glycated hemoglobin in obese individuals with diabetes who underwent therapeutic gastric bypass surgery. We conclude that Fst is a pathological hepatokine that might be targeted for diabetes therapy during hepatic insulin resistance.","2018-07","2021-07-12 06:55:42","2021-07-12 17:25:59","2021-07-12 06:55:42","1058-1069","","7","24","","Nat Med","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Transforming growth factor beta;Type 2 diabetes Subject_term_id: transforming-growth-factor-beta;type-2-diabetes-mellitus","","/Users/jonahlibrach/Zotero/storage/TXVTQR9T/Tao et al. - 2018 - Inactivating hepatic follistatin alleviates hyperg.pdf","","Boston; 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that Parp7 mono-ADP-ribosylates agonist-bound AR, and that ADP-ribosyl-cysteines within the N-terminal domain mediate recruitment of the E3 ligase Dtx3L/Parp9. Molecular recognition of ADP-ribosyl-cysteine is provided by tandem macrodomains in Parp9, and Dtx3L/Parp9 modulates expression of a subset of AR-regulated genes. Parp7, ADP-ribosylation of AR, and AR-Dtx3L/Parp9 complex assembly are inhibited by Olaparib, a compound used clinically to inhibit poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases Parp1/2.

The DRS is a conserved region that lies distal to the active site and mediates ERK–protein interactions. We demonstrate that the small molecule BI-78D3 binds to the DRS of ERK2 and forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (C159) within the pocket and disrupts signaling in vivo. BI-78D3 does not covalently modify p38MAPK, JNK or ERK5. BI-78D3 promotes apoptosis in BRAF inhibitor-naive and resistant melanoma cells containing a BRAF V600E mutation.

However, the role of IGF-1R signaling in cardiac fibroblasts is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the roles of IGF-1 signaling during agonist-induced cardiac fibrosis and evaluated the molecular mechanisms in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Using an experimental model of cardiac fibrosis with angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE) infusion, we found severe interstitial fibrosis in the AngII/PE infused myofibroblast-specific IGF-1R knockout mice compared to the wild-type mice. In contrast, low-dose IGF-1 infusion markedly attenuated AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that IGF-1-attenuated AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis through the Akt pathway and through suppression of rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCK)2-mediated α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression.
